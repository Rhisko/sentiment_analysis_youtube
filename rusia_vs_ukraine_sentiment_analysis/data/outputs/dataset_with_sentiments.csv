wow this is the worst take ever almost everything you said here is wrong russia is not winning the war they are gaining ground extremely slowly at massive cost russia is the one escalating by bringing another country into the war allowing the missile strikes that several european countries have already done is the most minor counterescalation possible escalating in a similar manner as russia would mean us boots on the ground,russia,negatif
this is one of the most realistic pieces ive seen when it comes to the russiaukraine war most other mainstream channels keep saying that ukraine is winning or holding on considerably whereas you even mentioned the peace treaty that the ukranian pm refused to take which essentially prolonged the war for no reason and yes its laughable how the west supports ukraine against the occupiers but not the palestinians against their occupiers despite the higher civilian count keep up the great work appreciate it,"russia, ukraine",positif
be careful about saying russia started this war no russia started the military aggression in 2022 the first illegal action that started this war was when a democrtically elected prsident yanukovych was illegaly impeached overthrown with the western support both political and financial after he had secured a 15 billion usd gas price at 70 deal with russia instead of an insulting 600 million eur deal with eu back in 2014 and after that revolution the new and illegal government has started spreading lies that yanukovych ordered to shoot the protesters there is no direct evidence against anyone even though he had actually made a deal with them a few days before that to calm things down and things started to indeed calm down before someone started shootingthe motive is all in favor of cia and democratic prowar policies youve described without that revolution russia would not have taken crimea peacefully with majority of ukrainians in crimea actually defecting to russia nor invaded in 2022 i had to censor some letters because youtube keeps on removing my comments,"russia, ukraine",positif

ukraine is fighting for her life as a country with freedom and democracy and these two political commentators who like to believe there is no middle east peace without palestian state autonomy deride the efforts by the us government to ensure she survives goes to show how difficult it is in big tent democratic coalition to find concensus when everyone looks after their own interests and pet topics,ukraine,positif
you think the american public hates war really this conservative nation just elected a guy whos promising to bring the military in to deal with the border crisis and possibly invade blue states polling seems to remain consistent that half of the united states supports sending aid to ukraine interesting is that the guy who claimed he could read polls when it came to biden dropping out of the election suddenly ignores them,ukraine,positif

you could hardly have shown better that you are simply illinformed naive and blinded by fear on this subject ana and cenkas a country under attack ukraine has the right to defend itself under international law which also means that it may attack military targets on the entire territory of the aggressor russia the critical mistake is therefore not to help ukraine to defend itself accordingly but to impose restrictions on ukraine to use weapons only on its own territory fun fact the west does not impose such restrictions on weapons to israelon this point ana and cenk clearly support russias view that ukraine should not be given this permissionrussia not the us is the one who doesnt want to stop escalating russia let its military invade ukraine russia targets ukrainian civilian infrastructure russia could stop the war at any time by ceasing all combat operations against ukraine and withdrawing its military but russia does not want to stop terrorizing the ukrainian peoplehere too ana and cenk take the russian view that it is not russia but the us that is escalating the situation further and furtherthe current situation is that neither ukraine nor russia can resolve the war militarilybut ana and cenk are again taking russias point of view and claiming completely unrealistically that russia is about to win the war militarilyrussia is well aware of the power of its mendacious propaganda and its empty threats of escalation or wwiii illinformed naive and fearblinded people believe every word from the kremlin and thus become putins useful idiots as you can easily see from the absurd statements of ana and cenk in the videorussia has no interest in wwiii it is not even capable of defeating ukraine militarily within 3 years so how is russia supposed to compete with the entire might of nato for almost 3 years now every country in the world has seen that russia is militarily weak and now on the verge of economic collapse due to western sanctions which country apart from north korea would want to fight alongside russia in a war against nato and why china out of loyalty certainly notand ana again repeats the longdisproved lie that the ukrainians did not continue peace talks with russia in 2022 because they were ordered to do so by boris johnson any editor or journalist who takes their job seriously and has looked into this matter knows full well that the ukrainians broke off peace talks with russia because of the revelation of the terrible russian war crimes in bucha,"russia, ukraine",positif

russia started the open war but the us has been bribing politicians interfering in elections expanding military alliances beyond what was assured to russia and generally waging cold diplomatic and political warfare for years not only that but the regions russia is trying to annex demonstrated democratically that they want to secede from ukraine and join the russian federation so russia are justified not only in retaliating but in annexing a region whose democratic mandate was denied and violently suppressed by the ukrainian government,"russia, ukraine",negatif

cenki have to disagree with you hereregarding nato promising russia that it will not expand anymore that was never a binding agreement but lets assume it was russia asked ukraine to return their nuclear weapons for security in 1991 yet russia invaded ukrainelongrange weapons into russian territory would help ukraine stop the russian advances and better negotiate a ceasefire most leftwing europeans have been asking that for a while recently russia changed its nuclear doctrine in my opinion its a way to scare the west into not providing any more weapons to ukraine but heres the thing russia was the one escalating and threatening the world with nuclear weapons heres a scenario lets say russia did use nuclear weapons battlefield or citykiller on ukraine do you think the west would say well stop providing weapons absolutely not they will retaliate and destroy russias capabilities thats the last thing putin wants to do unless he wants to see the world endanother scenario lets say the west does nothing and russia took over ukraine would putin stop the eastern block is terrified of a russian military aggression they do not want to live under putins regime lets say putin did not stop and then eventually nato will have to step in to defend if putin did stop he would have difficulty suppressing insurgence with a weakened militaryso the whole war in ukraine is a disaster for putin and russia they didnt expect a strong western response their conventional military is weak asking north korea help nearly 3 years in shows weakness theyve become a pariah state that depends on china and their economy could collapse in the next 5 to 10 yearsquestion then if putin is so concerned about russias security against nato and that he wouldnt invade a nonnato country why did sweden and finland join nato finland borders russia giving easy access for nato to invade i know war sucks and i see why many people are pissed off with the us being indirectly involved but dont fall for disinformation,"russia, ukraine",positif

okay heres the opposing view cenk this was far too little too late if we had given longrange missiles and more capability early on as in 18 months to 2 years ago they potentially would be winning the war right now and it wouldnt be a question we know that russia has these fictitious red lines that amount to nothing second this serves a significant purpose in telling our european allies that they too can send longrange weapons so when trump takes over they will already be sending longrange weapons whether we are or not at that point so you crane can continue fighting and can turn the tide of the war by all accounts ukraine can still very much win this war but the united states and our allies have restricted and handicapped them to the point where they have not been able to succeed sadly,"russia, ukraine",negatif

i have a lot of respect for tyt and cenk especially but on ukraine they have been consistently wrong alongside many american left pundits and many more on the right openly flirting with prorussia talking points ukraine is fighting an existential battle for its right to self determination and if they fall the entire european continent becomes directly ensnared in hot war granting ukraine the right to use longrange missiles should have happened months frankly years ago hitting russian war machine assets where under the cloak of legal handties they have been churning out death weapons without riskwe can have that argument on us military spending and what is too much for ukraine and i would agree europe should expand their own defence capabilities and is by the way i speak as a brit living in the uk we have spent billions every year on military support but separate to that should not be the us intentionally preventing ukraine from fighting back fairly in case they poke the bear when you are fighting an existential battle for your right as a sovereign peoples being told the weapons you can and cannot use is unacceptable many in the us seem unable to comprehend this probably because they feel safe and secure on their basically impregnable north american continent,"russia, ukraine",positif

there are several angles to see this first russia will likely escalate either by trying to use more devastating tactics in ukraine or by arming the us enemies or both second this could help ukraine prevent russian attacks on their infrastructure by destroying the weapons used against them inside russia third this could also help ukraine by disrupting russias logistics and manufacturing which could restrict russias mobilization of troops and equipment fourth if the damage in russia is severe russia may be tempted to use tactical nuclear weapons in ukraine overall this will help ukraine but it wont help them win the war because they just cant ukraine has a demographic disadvantage disparity that will become even more pronounced as the war continues second damage to ukraines infrastructure will continue to accumulate overtime making it harder to rebuild after the end of the war third ukraine does not have nuclear weapons if russia sees itself in danger they will use tactical nuclear weapons in ukraine in conclusion this was a war that ukraine could not fully win from the beginning given us and nato doctrine which is to avoid direct confrontation with russia getting rid of putin would not help as russia sees ukraine as an existential issue so it wouldnt matter who was in charge this war needed to be prevented before it became a war realistically speaking ukraine will effectively lose part of their territory and my prediction is that russia will not sign a peace treaty as doing so would allow what is left of ukraine from joining nato that is not in russias interest russia wants a buffer or control the land between them and the carpathian mountains they will only sign a truce or armistice which would prevent ukraine from joining nato as they would still be technically at war with russia if the us and europe wanted to prevent this outcome once it became clear that russia was about to invade ukraine in 2022 they should have mobilized large amounts of troops on russias borders and forced russia to similarly move their troops to keep them away from ukraine and to bankrupt them moving troops costs money nato and the us wont do this so the outcome of this war was already decided before it began,"russia, ukraine",positif

even if you accept that nato encroachment is the motivating factor of this conflict realize that natos border is right next door putins ambitions dont end with ukraine but hes not about to start with a nato member hes been betting on the alliance fracturing over ukraine and its western members abandoning its eastern european partners which would pave the way for further escalation up to and including military incursions this from the start has been a game of containing russian aggression to ukraine and sadly the wests restraint was to contain it within a non nato state at the expense of ukrainian soldiers and civilians biden has been very cautious to manage the risk of any russian retaliation but frankly at this point there is no credible russian deterrence as cenk and ana breeze over ukraine invaded russia they have been striking deep within russia and striking with shorter range us supplied weapons within russia nothing happened because putin has no credible optionsalso i would not be shocked if trumps team was behind this in part everyone who bought into russiagate like cenk assumed for far too long trump was at putins beck and call and yes hes shown a troubling admiration for dictators but he also like a good dictator doesnt want to appear weak hes not going to just give into russian demands and hed probably like there to be some pressure to strengthen the ukrainian position because yes russia is absolutely winning at the moment and frankly has been the entire time because they have a 31 population advantage and a military strategy of throwing waves of men into the meat grinder as they suffer 71 and 81 casualty ratios compared to ukrainian losses but the involvement of nk shows putin fears further mobilization but cenk is wrong this matters this move is just as much about sending a message to pyongyang that they best think twice about joining this fight,"russia, ukraine",negatif

the west did say that any country who chooses to join nato and which is in proximity to russia must not produce buy or own any atomic weapons the contract also stated that russia does not have a voice in which country decides to join the nato and russia accepted that so basically it is not true that the west promised russia that no country close to russia can t join nato also even if we had made this promise we nato and therefore the usa too promised ukraine if they get rid of their atomic aresenal we would defend them in case russia is starting aggresions or even a war nobody talks about that fact last put not least the war industrial complex will always win as long we fight wars around the world if we deescalate now and give russia what it wants in 5 years time we will have another conflict with russia and i don t want to know what an emboldend putin will do than europe must start looking after its own security and affaires the usa is neither trustworthy nor commited anymore to look support europe unfortunately,"russia, ukraine",positif

this whole war is a mess i get both sides putin like it or not is a very intelligent man and i believe he loves his country on the other hand you have the right to protect your sovereignty facts though are facts ukraine was working to join nato and there was a guarantee that nato would never be allowed to be next door to russia and that treaty was being broken plus biden was never a serious threat to putin and he knew it what does also to be true but cant call it a fact is that ukraine was known to be corrupt as heck just look at the deals little biden was orchestrating there we know that we just dont know if the president of ukraine was involved,"russia, ukraine",negatif

glad theyre battery powered i think that takes the wind out of most of the critique i know that as lefties we are generally antiwar but we need to remember that there are causes that people think are worth the blood they shed and the lives they give we are ukraines ally ukraine did nothing to warrant an military aggression in fact it gave up its nuclear arsenal decades ago in a show of good faith for peace if ukraine is to not be reinvaded in the future it needs to negotiate from a position of strength and it can only be in that position if it can properly fight against a much larger force the willingness to just abandon the fight and our allies is sort of indicative i think of much of the rot of the left its too esoteric for us here in america weve never been pressed like the ukrainians have,ukraine,positif

i always hear this argument escalation needs to stop go tell the russians that ukrainians were invaded cities literally obliterated over 20000 children kidnapped execution of prisoners intentionally bombing hospitals supermarkets why is it when this argument comes up it always people asking ukraine to not escalate when they are the ones fighting for their very survival its such a backward way of thinking thats like asking poland or france to stop escalating when they got invaded by the germans russia can literally end this war tomorrow by withdrawing their troops biden has simply given the ukrainians the ability to fight without their hands tied behind their backs the authorization was for strikes only in the kursk region putin is not going to nuke anyone he has been saying that since the beginning to try and get the west to back off and let him take what he wants do we want to set a precedent from here on out that threatening to use nuclear weapons to get what you want is okayyes we want the war to end but a just lasting peace will only be possible when ukraine is in a position of advantage at the table because if we let putin take the land he has conquered it only rewards this type of behavior in the future which will lead to actual us troops on the ground,"russia, ukraine",positif

not one single comment mentions why russia invaded ukraine back in 2000 secretary of state james baker of the united stated told russia that nato would not be moving one inch eastward russia told nato they did not want military bases on its borders just like the united states would not want to have russian military bases in northern mexico that is the real reason why the war started,"russia, ukraine",negatif
if we hand ukraine to russia because putin threatens to attack us with nuclear weapons then he will obviously use the same threat to demand the next country be handed over moldova will be first then georgia armenia azerbaijan and probably estonia all putin has to do is say surrender or i will attack with nuclear weapons soon it will be turkey that is next on putins list a nation that has wavered in its support for nato but become a bit more willing to stick with the alliance since the military aggression of ukraine what would we do then hand over turkey because putin has threatened us,"russia, ukraine",positif
there is no such thing as a humane war once war starts there will be unimaginable suffering and the manner of death is secondary the defending country has no choice but to use whatever weapons it can get because more people will die if the military aggression succeeds the idea that somehow putin will do something worse if the us provides weapons to ukraine is not logical putin is already as brutal and murderous as he can be if he were able to hold another draft he would do so he cannot because it would inflame opposition in russia if he were able to persuade his generals to use nuclear weapons he would do so he cannot because most of his generals dont want to be killed in a nato attack and would not follow such an order using icbms to carry conventional warheads is just posturing it is a very expensive way to deliver a conventional explosive,"russia, ukraine",negatif

what a bunch of clowns these people are the only thing wrong biden is doing is that he should have done this two years ago tyt do you think russia is playing nice with international rules fuck no get a clue those international treaties only work if both sides follow them and russia never has you cant win a war by being on the morally superior side russia will never nuke ukraine without a direct threat being made towards him he knows that it will escalate the war into a full blown conflict with europe and he knows that china is deeply against the use of nukes and might pull all support from russia stop thinking you can play nice with russia,"russia, ukraine",positif

can i just underline something here people you are all too much focused on what the puppeteer wants you to focus on if youre going from a clear example of a war of current dynamics at play it would be a nation of desperation versus the entitlement of one person do you really think that if the man were to have the support that ukraine has combined from one thingto be a nation and avoid falling into the hands of russiayou would have a threeyear war like you have nowthere is no reason why russia needs to be desperate its the biggest country there is so its only entitlement from a selfish one seeking to rule all versus something that is actually wanting to have a little bit of land to be a nation that everybody agrees upon in that nationhe cannot win the war because he has not had the people behind him from the start do you really think people are willing to die just because they are at the mercy of their own leader if thats the case for what reason would they die so he can get a little bit more land out of it they may have been sitting by with conflicted thoughts but they were not yet so much influenced because the war was taking place on the other sidebut do you really think that if russia is threatening others with i will nuke you or i will destroy your country that he is not also putting his own population at risk threatening someone elses nation inherently means threatening your ownremember he cannot even get his own people or even his soldiers to fully align with his motivations dont be fooled by him or his rhetoric he might say oh yes i will destroy you but if there was really a red line and he was truly suicidal what difference would it make now for him to push the button he doesnt do that because ambitious people are not suicidalthey are driven by anything else but suicidal thoughts they want to rule they want to be feared they want to control and if you are stepping out of life with everybody else its not even uniquepeople need to exist to feel fear you need existence to acknowledge your satisfaction of being feared and of controlthere is no way he is going to have any leverage its only about coming across as though we wouldnt be here otherwisethink about this if you are a country that thinks it has everything under control why would you need to control your peoples viewpoints this means the oppositehe doesnt have control thats why he is so desperate to prevent the real narrative and reality from reaching them if they get to see the truth they wont align or stand behind their socalled big leaderwhy would you need to control what others see you would only need to trust that what you believe they also believe that is true controlwhen you dont need to control the outer world coming inward to reveal whats really happeningdont be fooled support ukraine and never ever join the side of letting him win with a bluff that is absolutely nothing more than a bluff,"russia, ukraine",positif

right now the ukrainians need anything and everything because when trump comes in jan the war aid from the states will be cut off additionally the russians have internationalised the conflict with foreign mercernaries and north koreans frankly if the ukrainians used a million land mines at this point just to further throw russia and allies into a terrible meat grinder i would be frankly relieved the price the nato nations are paying in dollars the ukrainians are paying in blood and their soverign soil if russia gets to win this war may the victory be so pyrrhic so that their demographics are forever destroyed and they cannot wage another ground war for another 20 years may the opportunity not go unnoticed by china and may china annex russian land demoralising the nation beyond the point of recovery,"russia, ukraine",positif

biden obviously wants to hand off a messy situation for trump to deal with it gives ukraine a chance to stockpile these weapons between now and january before trump takes over and cuts aid to ukraine off entirely in favor of his buddy putin im sure biden will also pass off knowledge how ukraine can build their own after trump cuts off aid biden is most likely also establishing a network of private funding to ukraine by big players so ukraine can continue to cause pain for putin after biden has left office regardless of trump cutting them off it makes things difficult for trump he wont be able to give his buddy putin the upper hand in the fight like hed like to do i think biden should find many ways to bog down trump before he leaves office leave trump all kinds of messes to have to deal with keep trump off balance,"russia, ukraine",negatif
if palestine had the same capabilities as ukraine im sure cenk would say the palestinians have every right to use everything in their arsenal to push back against the invading aggressorsbut when it comes to ukraine its appeasement the us isnt the one escalating anything its the actions of putins escalation that the us is responding tooi agree with you guys tyt on almost 90 of the time on your domestic policies but on this particular foreign issue you guys seem to be on putin propaganda payroll,"russia, ukraine",negatif
