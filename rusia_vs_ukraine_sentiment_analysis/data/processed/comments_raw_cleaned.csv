its time for the us to upgrade its warfare technology this technology has already been more than three decades old i assume it will take this matter as serious as possible please dont wait until the enermy desploys many of those jammers on the fields,unknown
looks like an act of war america needs a real president one that hasnt been contaminated with socialism,unknown
if the russian federation is allowing or condoning hackers within its territories to interfere with the gps system so vital to safe navigation for civilian airliners and passengers it has truly become a pariah state on the global stage,russia
gps jamming tech was available to us from reverse engineering secrets of skin walker ranch in the tv documentary the ancient aliens had the prototype buried in triangle areas under the interdimensional wormhole on the utah ranch,unknown
if russia can jam the bread they can eat it aswell,russia
we are supplying them,unknown

why do they not use the civil version of glonass galileo and other traditional navigation options to increase the precision of gps and why do they not use data from spy satellites,unknown
how could this be i thought ukraine downed 7000 of the total 1400 missiles that russia ever releasedand ukraine also downed 9000 of the 400 drones that russia ever released and ukraine also shot down 3500 of the entire 140 total jet fighters that russia ever used in ukraine i heard that zelenskyy was a comedian and a clown but this is the first time i heard he was a magician as well,"russia, ukraine"
what did you expect,unknown
russian technology is amazing,russia
jamming the gps used for targeting system is part of every electronic warfare system that is a reality even the us have them and is using them in ukraine they are complaining because it appears that the russians is better their missiles gps guided bombs and artillery rounds are missing their targets back to the drawing board,"russia, ukraine"
lol the russians just fked up space force and its too funny and then just in case you thought they couldnt do it they shoot down a satellite i imagine though that american satellites have special fancy radar absorbing paint or material on them that makes them much more difficult to target,russia
so cant we jam their signals too,unknown
political drama propagandas from our end against russiaweve got nothing else to do,russia
yep thought so how else would those tanks hidden in the woods have gotten nailed,unknown
great work president putin,russia

russia understands very well the technology of the west,russia
i never needed gps i m used to reading cards,unknown
good russia keep going,russia
war tactics to get the russians to start jamming drones and exposed their position for the himars remember they said ukraine was getting ready for a counter in donbass then the russians focus their defense in that region and then boom all their bases in crimea destroyed,"russia, ukraine"

oh that is so sad given that america has used ukrainian hackers for years to operate bots on all the social media platforms registered in the us to sway public opinion around election times it seems a bit sad that russia has some method of blocking gpss handed to the hapless ukrainian flunkies of the fourth reich whom i am certain are starting to ask what it like in the hague at this time of year blinken should be to,"russia, ukraine"

it was obvious that the us controlled the drones now they are loosing controlthe question who is fighting against whom may have a wwiii on our hand,unknown
what to they expect the russians to allow their positions to be given away i can imagine its a normal tactic in war,russia
so there is nothing secure line after multibillions of dollars spent on technologies,unknown

people might want to look into hunter bidens laptop im sure it has a lot to do with this war in ukraine,ukraine

as they should wtf we doing there giving them weapons and targets we got a dog in this fight regardless of our governments lies,unknown
russia is not iraq,russia
of course they would jam the civilian code give the ukrainians access to the y code encryption if we truly consider them allies wont help where the ukrainians are using civilian gps systems but it will give their military some capability especially if they are using western smart weapons and we have not provided glonass spooferjammers to the ukrainians that would be odd,ukraine
is that the space force psaki made fun of,unknown

what is happening to the russian soldiers who have lost their lives for putin the man who doesnt care what happens to them if the ukrainians really have many dead russian soldiers then it would be a big coupe for them if they could return them to their families in russia on the 8th or 9th of may which is victory day in russia who knows it might be a victory day for the ukrainians too and bring an end to this senseless war and give proof to the russian people who deserve to know what has happened to their sons and daughters in putins war on ukraine,"russia, ukraine"
pres putinsor modernday emperor paranoia or imagined threat is getting wider finlandand sweden are considering joining nato also they are pushed by the recent military aggression of ukraine if putin can do this to his brothers sistersas what he thinks in ukraine the more he can do it elsewhere so finland is getting swarmed by russian troops in her border lately if we are going to follow the pattern its worrisome to be a neighbor of russia you are immediately perceived as an enemy once you show intention of joining nato so finland norway estonia latvia georgia azerbaijan etc are all in danger of being invaded once they copy what ukrainians did this is serious pres putin is entertaining an empty threat in his mind,"russia, ukraine"
so where is space force take out russias satellites,russia
russia is the big boss,russia
take out the russian glosnas satellites us gps needs to be changed and updated china and russia using the us gps is absolute stupidity on the side of the us,russia
us are wrong to have gps in ukrainian,ukraine
who jammed the moskvas communications a small drone or a growler or awacs nearby someone blinded the moskva and let ukraine have a guided potshot at the russian ship who did this thats a six milkion dollar question if someone can find the answer you will findout who really killed 400 russian sailors,"russia, ukraine"

accuse of jamming what do you expect the russian to do sit and watch how the world fight against the eastern orthodox church what sort of bogus information war you are playing against the russia atleast they have not slaughtered a million ukranian,russia
most civilians in the westus also use russian satellites too glonass there are four major satellite systemsnetworks its a standard tactic to jam or attempt to monitor communications in a war zone,russia
russia is talking to usa in the language that it understands,russia
putin you are the man,russia
just switch over to the russian gps signals those are not jammed,russia
it seems that ukraine war game just has got a twist,ukraine
time to crusiesmissleattacktheyace,unknown

well of coursewhat did you expect,unknown
so us admitted they are involved in this war can you stay in your fq continent and stop bringing wars to other countries,unknown
unfortunately putin has been planning this scenario for 22 years and knew it would be bloody and costly and would lose lot of men just like both world wars before this unfortunately we are not dealing with a unexperienced man hes a kgb assassin with the most sophisticated powerful nuclear arsenal on the planet and with the most powerful air defense system in the world that nato fears the most specially if they have to fight russia in a national survival war like the nazis because the grim reality of past has repeated itself again in the 21st century and once again we were expecting different results unfortunately no one has learned anything from it now in 2022 and now because everyday this war goes on in ukraine the doomsday clock ticks closer the start ww3 at anytime or worse go right to a nuclear war if japan or any other country backs ukraine with soldiers like japan is about to do and there military over ukraine to help stop putin from annexing any more old soviet territory in his next step to push nato out of his soviet warsaw pact territory which has been more vunerble and distracted and more vunerable than anytime since ww2 thats already suffered and lost a lot because there in the middle of the worst pandemic in modern history and now possibly the next world war is right at there doorstep so be very concerned people this is no joke especially now with china with eyes of a hawk watching everything unfold very carefully and could launch a attack on tiwann and use the south china sea to do its just waiting for the usa to make the wrong mistake and be caught off guard with the war with russia and its allies estein said the next war would be with sticks and stones because nothing would be left but a dying radioactive planet uninhabitable for centuries and if someone did survive and managed to get enough people together for another one it would be the cave man way and nothing else just like the movie threads only this time its ukraine that starts it not iran now in todays war with russia,"russia, ukraine"
russia is use to taking high casualties and prepared for it they lost 27 million in ww2 and it took millions to just to break the back of nazi germany putin doesnt care about that he knows hes already one because nato is afraid of nuclear war if they interfere so all he has to do now is get ukraine to surrender and if that means leveling cities to the ground then so be putin told the civilians to evacuate many times before the military aggression and said this will be bloody and brutal so if you dont want to die leave now and lay down your arms but they chose to stay and think this was a joke and putin wouldnt evade even when he had almost 200000 men at ukraines doorstep and we told there president he would invade right after the olympics but everyone in ukraine thought it was a joke and russia would go home as soon as they were hit with sanctions and chose to stay and even worse fight and have there families fight when they didnt need to when they have a powerful ground ukraine army that knows how to fight there own kind and doesnt need civilians getting in the way making it harder for them to do there job and much much more dangerous now for everyone because they stayed and chose poorly unfortunately,"russia, ukraine"
god bless putin a real peace keeper our city in donbass has been shelled by ukrainian nazis for 8 years the ukrainians murdered thousands of people since 2014 unfortunately not a single word in the media the government is completely fascist god bless russia and every russian soldier you you guys live on the other side of the world and have never seen these were crimes committed by ukraine so i suggest you guy go back to being tik tokers instead of political war experts thank you putin its not putin our country would be worse than iraq nato is a ruthless war machine thank you russia for stoping these cowards,"russia, ukraine"

what is funnier is that lavrov is right and the people who are laughing have zero insight of the reasons why the ukranian conflict happenedthe conflict in ukraine started with the coup in ukraine what was backed by american interest the separatist parts of ukraine were the proof that not the whole country was eager to join to the west and when zelensky ignored the minsk agreements he did it because america gave him its support to do that so sure russia invaded ukraine but america was not interested in ukraine and russia making peace at allthe american interest still is to use ukraine to weaken russia and to separate europe from russian energy and influence it has nothing to do with the independence of ukraine and you will all see this when america will back from supporting ukraine in the near future because it will no longer serve american interest just as america did in afghanistani mean it is just hard to watch that america did the same exact thing in the middle east in several countries where they created conflicts to divide and rule and to get resources and put pressure on countries but when it happens in europe suddenly everyone forgets what america did in the past to benefit itself at the cost of whole regionsi am not shifting blame from russia to america by the way i do not have double standards if i have to condemn russia for its actions then i have to use the same moral values when i judge the collective west too so i cant pretend that russia was unprovoked to start military action against ukraine because i am not blind to american interest in the region,"russia, ukraine"

its interesting to me how media claims russia has suffered heavy losses russia has almost exclusively sent sub 1990sera equipment to fight ukraine look at the total russian losses they have only lost 10 fighter jets and havent used any new tanks all those high numbers of tanks that were lost were soviet era tanks bandaged together and sent out with minimal refueling plans the only thing russia has actually lost is people and they are very used to that russia always comes back from heavy losses trust putin will be keeping the best troops and hardware for moscow i hope ukraineamerica puts an end to this war i hate my tax dollars funding the death of both nations it is ideocracy to believe that putin isnt crazy enough to use nukes this is dangerous for all of us no matter where you live please wake up and protest the war putin has publicly said nukes are not off the table 7 times in the last 2 years why does nobody talk about how this will be a cold war soon,"russia, ukraine"

ukraine has lost two armies and is on its last their main and reserve armies have been decimated their last army is a mix of wounded veterans and conscripted boys and old men its estimated that ukraine has lost anywhere from 7 to 10 men for every one russian ukrainians are constantly begging for support because they are losing so terribly all western promises of resistance in certain key points of the war have been rescinded now that china has clearly shown support for russia and russian battles are turning up chinese equipment the west is in a conundrum they do not know how to leave this war without looking like complete fools just like in iraq and especially afghanistans withdrawal under braindead biden notice every key city of defense has slowly fallen now bakhmut will be next the offensive has stopped due terrible operating conditions ie mud read a book about germans on the ost front in ukraine same issues once mid springsummer arrives the land will become stable tanks and other vehicles will again have unlimited access notice there have been very limited footage of russian regulars operating in theatre wagner group has taken out large amounts of enemy resistance without traditional army personnel and they are still in a state of overwhelming success there hasnt even been one sighting of a t14 armata in battle yet russia has yet to deploy any of its state of the art war fighting equipment hundreds of firsthand accounts on youtube with international legion volunteers have all commonly claimed similar complaint no artillery support no ammunition no food no water and many times abandoned by their main forces ukraine will capitulate and zelenski will either hang or flee to america zelenski has done nothing but kill generations of ukrainian men the west will continue to say ukraine is winning until there is one man left standing its called propaganda the west does not want a war with the brics nations the brics nations have all of the raw material extremely cheap labor and manufacturing capabilities which the eu and america have sold out long ago america and the eu are constantly over budget and fail to pass deadlines regarding military build up china has recently taken place of having the biggest navy in the world due to these exact issues mentioned above the brics nations are focused on national pride and betterment of oneself while america and the eu have never been so divided due to the govts blatant focusing on the well being of foreigners immigrants and trivial issues regarding diversity and multiculturalism which is not a strength unfortunately america has reached its peak in being the world leader in almost everything as in all things of this world everything comes to an end america was a bright flame and bright flames fizzle out the fastest nations whove kept their own people cultures languages religions and identies in the forefront will be the only ones to continue its called being united being diverse and betraying your native peoples for monetary gain has clearly failed america is no longer a country america is a business its no longer one people and its sure as hell not united but you can keep getting your propaganda news and let them make your own decisions and conclusions of the world for you,"russia, ukraine"

there is nothing wrong per se in getting involved in a conflict it depends on what the conflict c is about standing aside when you countrys help save a nation from being occupied and enslaved as is happening with putins war against ukraine is neither moral nor good political sense since it simply invites more of the same i take you do not agree i think you are need of a history lesson on the second war,"russia, ukraine"

interesting how the usa promised russia to not encroach near them at the same time ignoring the interests of the countries that border with russia as if their opinions do not matter,russia
what the hell biden dont poke the bear,unknown
is this why biden was smiling hahaha trump this situation is your problem now they really dont want trump the american people to succeed,unknown
why is it acceptable for russia to launch ballistic missiles and cruise missiles comfortable from inside russia mobilise forces for offensives right on the border yet totally unacceptable for ukraine to engage those targets in russia keep in mind the missiles ukraine has gotten from the west are all shortrange cruise missiles none of them can reach moscow or almost any other large russian city they can however reach ammunition depots and airbases relatively close to ukraine which we know russia has used as launch platforms in the past and currently,"russia, ukraine"

russia started the war the war started in 2014 with ukraine killing its own citizens in the donbas,"russia, ukraine"
terrible decision on bidens part imo,unknown
biden and the democrats want ww3 especially under trumps watch they dgaf about america,unknown
i generally appreciate tyts political coverage but their take on this conflict sounds more like rt the normalizedclickbait title alone would unwittingly satisfy the kremlins press officeanyone who has paid attention to the conflict over the past 1000 days knows putin is already doing everything he can which even included calling north korea for emergency intervention russia using nuclear weapons or attacking nato would both plainly be suicidal for them and thats before you factor in that their ground forces are entirely bogged down in ukraine kursk bleeding increasinglyuntrained men and increasinglypoor equipment at the highest rate since ww2but putin said hed use nukes if the west did this yeah hes a broken record at this point the experts knew he was bluffing before and he will continue to do just that regardless of whether more of his bases become vulnerable overnight ukraines limited supply of longer range missiles is not going to make russia significantly more desperate than they already are merely make their war harder and costlier to sustain everyone involved in the conflict knows that yet the kremlin will keep trying to scare voters and politicians abroad because as tyt demonstrate it sadly works on the lessinformed,"russia, ukraine"
please point to a map and tell me which country are you not willing to tolerate the kidnapping of children and killing of civilians in where will you draw the lineand cenk and anna if youre so eager to trade land for peace you are more than welcome to offer your homes to putin but leave ukraine out of this theyve held the line against tyranny while you eat quarter pounders and flatulate on your chair,"russia, ukraine"
i love you guys but you just dont know what is happening in ukraine nor what is happening in russia ukraine cannot defend itself from the archers fighter jets firing missiles navy ships firing missiles drone units all who daily yes daily launch drones and missiles into civilian targets including electric power stations 300000 civilians are without water or electric in odessa from an air attack a few days ago ukrainian strikes into russian territory are to prevent the archers from killing ukrainians ukraine has been using drones to take out the amno the planes the drone manufacturers the headquarters the logistics inside russia nightly but that is like a pea shooter against a bomb you both fortunately know very little about war and about what can stop putin plus he always plays the nuclear card but there is no advantage to him to do so the response from china india the us and europe would leave him and russia totally isolated and he know their would be a military response there is no such thing as a defensive war if you arent allowed to fire back at your enemys logistics on their territory you wont stand a chance ukraine is near becoming independent from the us and russia is in stagflation and inflation there central bank interest is at 21 and will rise again in december mortgage rates are 28 to get a soldier to enlist they are paying a 30000 sign up bonus that is why putin called the dprk to send soldiers i want this war over but ukraine is not going to be told what to do by pres elect dump nor anyone else,"russia, ukraine"

north korean troops on the ground fighting with russia tells me putin has no intentions on stopping this war and there is nothing trump can do or say putin is the big dog not trump,russia
russia has been using glide bombs they bolt wings onto a bomb fly to the border of ukraine and let the bombs go they glide in and hit their targetsrussia has been expecting these missiles to get the green light for a while and they moved their jets to air fields out of the range of atacms months ago mostly they will move the planes and attack different areas of ukraineit looks like ukraine was able to hit a couple ammo dumps with these missiles but overall we dont expect them to be able to destroy a ton of stuffmostly it just hurts russian logistics it makes them use more jet fuel to bomb ukraine and they have to truck in ammo from further awayukraine has been asking for these missiles for two years they expect an escalation from russia but not nuclear war russia has been doing a lot of covert operations in europe and they expect these to step up in response with these now allowed by the us its more likely the british and german governments to now give them their storm shadow and taurus missiles respectively both of these missiles have a longer range than the us atacmsi would expect similar restrictions on use with these missile systems so i repeat myself i wouldnt expect ukraine to go crazy bombing everything in russia i expect this to somewhat hurt russias logistics definitely a good thing for ukraine but not a complete game changer in the war and not a ton of escalation,"russia, ukraine"
biden did this to see if trump is going to be able to stop world war 3 trump are you ready i dont thinks so,unknown

wow i really dont agree with this stance ive seen it in european far left parties too its like a generation of people that grew up during peace and who think peace is the default mode and that if you do nothing it comes back to that well its more simple than that war is there and you handle it or not later is worse than sooner,unknown
biden is a coward,unknown
i agree with most of the stuff you stand for but not negotiating with russia and stopping the resistance in ukraine,"russia, ukraine"

as a european this is a terrible take on the ukraine war,ukraine
i back bidens position and back ukraine f russia and f putin ukraine is on the frontline of russian aggression if they fall poland is next then sweden and norway stand with ukraine,"russia, ukraine"
so tyt really have had a proper story on the ukraine for over a year now ever since the approval of f16s in between now and then weve had ukrainian infrastructure destroyed bother power and medical the russians have struck multiple public places in ukraine killing civilians including children weve had nk soldiers come in and only now they comment on something happening either talk about it as much as israel or dont mention it at all you cant have it both ways also there was no official agreement between the soviets and nato also asks yourselves why former soviet controlled states why they joined nato because we never forced them,"russia, ukraine"
the longer russia wastes its manpower and money in ukraine the less of a danger they will be to the rest of the eu,"russia, ukraine"
do not blame biden escalated w n korea,unknown
you have turned around on so many issues you are becoming meaningless,unknown
biden is a lame duck but still have to give the green light for strategic strikes inside russia that ukraine has to be able to do to have a fighting chance this is not an escalation in that senseputin can whine and huff and puff all he wants he is extremely pressured already so this is great news this permission should have been given from day onealso this military industrial complex line and screwing the democratic party normally would agree but ffs putin has talked about restoring russias glory since the berlin wall fell you really do want russia to win in ukraine that would be terrible for eu and us,"russia, ukraine"
tyt being hyperbolic and shouldnt be comparing the two,unknown
wow this is the worst take ever almost everything you said here is wrong russia is not winning the war they are gaining ground extremely slowly at massive cost russia is the one escalating by bringing another country into the war allowing the missile strikes that several european countries have already done is the most minor counterescalation possible escalating in a similar manner as russia would mean us boots on the ground,russia
830 biden authorized the iraq war did cenk misspeak,unknown
this is one of the most realistic pieces ive seen when it comes to the russiaukraine war most other mainstream channels keep saying that ukraine is winning or holding on considerably whereas you even mentioned the peace treaty that the ukranian pm refused to take which essentially prolonged the war for no reason and yes its laughable how the west supports ukraine against the occupiers but not the palestinians against their occupiers despite the higher civilian count keep up the great work appreciate it,"russia, ukraine"
be careful about saying russia started this war no russia started the military aggression in 2022 the first illegal action that started this war was when a democrtically elected prsident yanukovych was illegaly impeached overthrown with the western support both political and financial after he had secured a 15 billion usd gas price at 70 deal with russia instead of an insulting 600 million eur deal with eu back in 2014 and after that revolution the new and illegal government has started spreading lies that yanukovych ordered to shoot the protesters there is no direct evidence against anyone even though he had actually made a deal with them a few days before that to calm things down and things started to indeed calm down before someone started shootingthe motive is all in favor of cia and democratic prowar policies youve described without that revolution russia would not have taken crimea peacefully with majority of ukrainians in crimea actually defecting to russia nor invaded in 2022 i had to censor some letters because youtube keeps on removing my comments,"russia, ukraine"
anas nunbers are way off the destruction of mariuopol itself is estimated to have killed well over 20000 we dont know though as russia wont let snyone investigate bunch of feckless cowards let ukraine fight as they want to fight they were invaded their people are being raped murdered and abducted if ukraine wants to negotiate thats on themwe pressured them to give up their nuclear weapons we also did not encroach they came to nato and the eu we are morally responsible for them i guess the the young turks is alright with rape and murder child abductions and bonbing childrens hospitals as long as russia is doing it and not israel,"russia, ukraine"
ukraine is fighting for her life as a country with freedom and democracy and these two political commentators who like to believe there is no middle east peace without palestian state autonomy deride the efforts by the us government to ensure she survives goes to show how difficult it is in big tent democratic coalition to find concensus when everyone looks after their own interests and pet topics,ukraine
you think the american public hates war really this conservative nation just elected a guy whos promising to bring the military in to deal with the border crisis and possibly invade blue states polling seems to remain consistent that half of the united states supports sending aid to ukraine interesting is that the guy who claimed he could read polls when it came to biden dropping out of the election suddenly ignores them,ukraine
all putin has to do is wait a few weeks he won his propaganda war against the west and has effectively neutralized the usa the usa will be closed for remodeling in january,russia
would not have to increase power if russia didnt invite north korean troops people blame biden but this is purely russias escalation if putin wants to end the world he can and nothing anyone can do about it,russia
hmm i think biden should have made this decission 2 years ago but rest assured in a month and a half trump will be president and he will resolve the issue on a day 1 and regarding israel he will resolve that on day 2 to the full satisfaction of all palestinians no doubt,unknown
biden is arguably the worst and most dangerous us president ever thank god he and his useless dumb vp are out to top it off this clown sleepy joe approves long range missles in ukraine in his last month in office just so he can leave a bigger mess for next president,ukraine
manifest destiny a legacy of roman colonialism and its modern implications in american politics and nativ minority strugglesintroductionthe united states history is fraught with instances of violence and systemic displacement of indigenous peoples central to this process was manifest destiny a 19thcentury ideology that promoted the expansion of the us from the atlantic to the pacific oceans smith 2018 the belief that americans were divinely ordained to settle the continent fueled the dispossession of native lands however this wasnt solely a secular missionit was deeply intertwined with religious institutions particularly the catholic church through its influence over indigenous boarding schools the church was complicit in widespread cultural destruction and abuse jackson 2021 moreover roman autocracys cooptation of christianity for political ends has left a legacy of religious manipulation that continues to affect marginalized groups today miller 2022the doctrine of manifest destiny and its impactmanifest destiny was an expansionist political doctrine and a divine mandate many european americans justified their right to expand and conquer indigenous lands based on the belief that it was their godgiven duty brown 2019 this allowed settlers to engage in violent and oppressive actions with moral impunity as the displacement of native tribes was framed as part of a broader civilizing mission treaties such as the fort laramie treaty of 1868 which was supposed to protect indigenous lands were ignored as soon as economic interests such as the discovery of gold in the black hills arose us department of the interior 2021 the doctrine also had deep connections to the catholic church whose involvement in colonization extended through missionary work and the establishment of boarding schools by merging religion with expansionism the us government and church leaders justified the subjugation of indigenous peoples miller 2022 manifest destiny provided the ideological framework for what would become one of the most destructive campaigns against native populations in us historycatholic boarding schools and cultural genocideperhaps one of the darkest chapters in us history was the establishment of catholicrun boarding schools where indigenous children were forcibly removed from their homes and placed under the control of clergy these institutions were designed to assimilate native children into european american culture by erasing their identities languages and traditions jackson 2021 tragically many children suffered from physical and sexual abuse at the hands of priests a crime that has been covered up for decades smith 2021 recent discoveries of mass graves near former boarding schools in canada and the us have shed light on the extent of the abuse smith 2021 the catholic churchs role in this cultural genocide is undeniable as these schools were often funded and operated under the guise of religious charity this systemic abuse left lasting scars on indigenous communities contributing to generational trauma that persists today jackson 2021the black hills lawsuit and modern indigenous resistancethe legal fight for the black hills represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle of indigenous peoples for justice after gold was discovered in the black hillsland sacred to the siouxthe us government seized the territory in direct violation of the fort laramie treaty us department of the interior 2021 decades later in 1980 the supreme court ruled that the us had stolen the black hills and ordered financial compensation however the sioux rejected the monetary award insisting their sacred land be returned white green 2020 this legal victory while significant underscores the limitations of colonial law for the sioux the land itself is irreplaceable and the us governments refusal to return it demonstrates the continued marginalization of indigenous sovereignty smith 2018 modern movements like land back are part of a broader push for the restitution of indigenous lands and the decolonization of us policies brown 2019roman autocracy and the manipulation of catholic doctrinethe connection between roman autocracy and catholicism dates back to the roman empire when political leaders saw the church as a means of controlling the masses miller 2022 roman emperors adopted christianity as the state religion using its teachings to justify their power and control over the population this manipulation of religion has continued throughout history with the catholic church often allying itself with political powers to maintain influence in the us this legacy of religious manipulation is evident in the role the catholic church played in colonizing indigenous lands and oppressing marginalized communities jackson 2021 the churchs involvement in manifest destiny and the boarding school system shows how religion has been used to justify expansion and cultural destruction under the guise of moral superiority miller 2022the second gilded age and modern parallelstoday the us is in what many scholars call the second gilded agea period characterized by extreme wealth inequality and corporate influence over politics white green 2020 much like during the first gilded age when manifest destiny was in full swing modern political elites used propaganda and religious rhetoric to maintain control the influence of the catholic church and other religious institutions can still be seen in political movements that promote nationalism and exclusionary policies this period also marks a resurgence in indigenous activism as movements like the fight for the black hills and land back seek to reclaim stolen lands and restore sovereignty to native nations smith 2018 indigenous peoples are at the forefront of resistance to modern forms of colonialism challenging the structures that have oppressed them for centuries brown 2019conclusionmanifest destiny the catholic churchs involvement in boarding schools and the legal fight for the black hills all demonstrate the ongoing impact of colonialism on indigenous communities by merging political power with religious authority the us government and the catholic church justified the violent expansion and displacement of native peoples today indigenous communities continue to resist these structures asserting their rights to land and sovereignty in the face of ongoing marginalization as the second gilded age unfolds it is crucial to recognize the parallels between past and present and to support efforts for decolonization and justicereferences

listening to the clownish threats coming from zelenskyy missiles will speak for themselves what an idiot,ukraine
can biden extend his term due to a national emergency such as war with russia,russia
i would say for what i read below that ca 70 of your audience disagree with you ana and cenk rethink your position you are totally wrong,unknown
i dont think it is a mistake he knows trump is coming in and knows where hes at with wanting to settle a deal with the two countries he also knows the replublican house and presidency will not send money to the ukrain and is giving them a fighting chance,unknown
oh my this is so bollocks what u r saying,unknown
there is no country more brave today than ukraine there is only one evil here and it is the putins regime you dont seem to highlight that enough at tyt you dont really care about the injustice suffered by the ukranian people imagine if america is invaded whould you have the same views as you believe ukraine must have giving up territory no having any weapons to defend yourself you are hypocrites,"russia, ukraine"
guys you have no clue what you are talking about russia is not winning the war thats number one number two the russias kursk region was not taking for territory bargaining that was the war strategic move also you do not have any experience in the military you do not know about ukraine and russia inside and or out you think you know and you are making judgement calls based on the media that you are criticizing in the different videos,"russia, ukraine"
russia is not winning the war how is their black sea fleet doingrussia had more ukraine territory in the first days than they have now how many russian lives are lost you guys are way off base here i usually agree with you guys this should have been done two years ago the war would be over russia has had redlines for everything from javelins to himars to atacms you guys are wrong,"russia, ukraine"
you progressives are just weak and scared you had the opportunity to have a seat at the white house for 4 years as you deserved yet you just obeyed biden for few achievements even the aholes of sinema and manchin had more power than all of you really pathetic i hope you recognize that the trump win was also partially your fault you did not fight biden and his support for rightwing israel enough and other things you just feared to lose to trump and it was exactly what happened no mea culpa in the progressive movement only blaming the other dems if you would have a little bit of spine long ago you would have a progressive party what do you going to do now nothing just keep going you will never have a seat at the white house or else unless you have your own party build a real party people will only join you because you are not just behind mamas skirt and no fing centrist dem candidate and in the long run you will win that is the path but only if you are brave,unknown
in bidens mind we have to help europe and win wwii,unknown
cenk you are wrong and you are a coward anna is a pro trump putin traitor go joe and the free world,russia
you guys at tyt could not be more mistaken if biden wanted to favor the military industrial complex he would already have approved the atacms and more long ago he did not until finishing his term this argument is ridiculous as well your remarks that ukraine is losing the war,ukraine
looking at these comments i truly see how the democrats have become the party of endless wars liz cheney would have been right at home,unknown
are you actually blaming this on the us the us didnt start this russia did they took crimea they invaded ukraine putin is not an honest actor hes not reasonable and hes not going to stop willingly its not biden doing a last minute escalation its putin needs to be stopped and diplomacy hasnt worked with him because hes not reasonable,"russia, ukraine"
839 saying to ukraine maybe you start a giant war with russia wtf are you smoking,"russia, ukraine"
escalate russia is bringing in 100k north korean troops if ukraine falls who is next russia has a master plan to take back all former soviet union vassal states,"russia, ukraine"
you guys are amazingly wrong here if france had bailed on our forefathers wed prolly still be under the kings rule now if biden and jake sullivan werent such pssies ukraine shouldve had those lr missiles available to them when they launched the counteroffensive in the south in 22 give putin all he asks for and every dictator will be lining up to get theyr share iran china nk etc war is hell yea but liberty and freedom are earned and all ukraine asks is for the means to achieve what they want but if you give putin that 20 hell definitely be back for more in 510 years and xi will send in his forces on taiwan deal with putin now i say and give ukraine the means to do it,"russia, ukraine"
first time ive ever disagreed with you trump is controlled by putin trump will do as he is told by putin trump will negotiate a deal favorable to russia in other words russia wins and ukraine loses then russia invades moldova latvia estonia lithuania and all of the other former soviet vassal states do you honestly believe europe will stand idly by while russia reassembles the soviet union russian aggression will start wwiii not ukraine using weapons to defend itself,"russia, ukraine"
tyt wrong side of history wrong side of reality wrong side of morality honestly done with you guys given all the screeching from you about a gaza genocide and there is an actual mass scale genocide going on in the biggest country in europe not a tiny sliver of land 10kmx40km and thats no big deal to you not worth fighting for to you shameful,unknown
biden allows long distance weapons to hit targets inside russia good finally russia will never stop why shouldnt ukraine be able to take out their supply lines and russia will never attack the west for allowing ukraine to shoot into russia putin knows russia is a demolition site if he attacks the west,"russia, ukraine"
russians can invade russian can send koreans to invade ukraine but ukraine cannot launch an offensive right,"russia, ukraine"
your wrong tyt,unknown
if mexico decided to be a socialist communist county and align itself with russia and china even allowed bases to be built therewhat would america do would they allow itbut yet u want to do expand nato to russias doorstep and dont expect them to react,russia
tyt sounds like you are about to bring back jimmy dore and have tulsi on as special guest sigh what next biolabs,unknown
the long range missles maybe too little too late,unknown
biden was letting the zios steal gaza well before trump,unknown
love tyt but they fail to see that russia is a bully and we all know how to deal with bullies we stop russia we stop all the other countries thinking about taking land,russia
its a war ana do you expect russia to play softball once trump hands ukraine over to them,"russia, ukraine"
biden will be remembered for the most catastrophic foreign policy failures in us history,unknown
cenk im glad you mention the part when nato would not encroached east it is true fact,unknown
actually russia has been provoked beyond all reason to enter ukraine in the smo j sachs will explain if u listen so as usaul usa usa war propaganda continues to say us has no choice but to excalate joke and more jokes biden never should have gotten close to any political office as he has done nothing for the people ever got us c thomas on the court stabbed bernie bailed out criminal bankers forever lies so now we are in a question of what will russia do to respond s ritter doesnt think the the 1st choice will b nukes but expects a devastating strike v kiev govt then well c however he thinks russia must respond decisively recall that this war has been ongoing since 2022 post maidan coup post minsk accords 1 and 2 ritter thinks we r closer to nluke war than ever why is the devil bidenblinken still allowed around us,"russia, ukraine"
good its the right time for 2 reasons pain for russia and confused and chief just got the middle finger from biden on his way out,russia
wow i love tyt but you guys are always way off on your ukraine coverage only 11k dead ana do you not realize you sound exactly like the zios when you say that also as of november 15 2024 37 million people were internally displaced within ukraine while 67 million refugees have fled to other countries i would say youre misinformed but since your job is literally the news i really wonder what is motivating this willful ignorance of the facts,ukraine
biden legacy is one of the most hideous in modern politics good thing he wont remeber it,unknown
thankyou for providing honest reporting and real logical options with major bias aside i was a yt member back in jill pike days 2005 i took a few years away recently and im back now as an open minded proponent of what you do i agree with 70 and happy to be here keep up the great reporting,unknown

tyt has failed the people no longer support them,unknown
ok so if you dont want to support ukraine maybe return them at least 13rd of their arsenal that they gave away,ukraine
on times radios frontline program military analyst philip ingram speculated that the recent us greenlight for ukraine to use longrange missiles on russian soil might actually be connected to trump ingram pointed out how after trump won the election russian state tv attempted to smear melania trump by publishing and mocking her old nude modeling photos according to ingram this was likely an intimidation tactic by putin to show whos in charge a classic move from an exspys playbook he suggested that trumps team might have influenced bidens team to approve this move possibly to give trump more negotiating leverage down the line its an intriguing and plausible perspective especially considering the timing of events trumps call with putin the state tv smear right after the election win and now this missile decisioni also appreciated ingrams assessment that the war wont be decided tactically but rather at the operational and strategic levels areas where ukraine clearly holds the initiative constantly declaring that ukraine is losing the war seems like announcing a defeat which is far from the reality on the groundthe times radio video mentioned is titled putin visibly shocked by us greenlight for longrange missiles to strike inside russia,"russia, ukraine"
so russia can invade they can use weapons from iran china and north korea but as soon as ukraine can finally hit back now parts of the western world complaining this will start ww3 no russia started it by invading another country,"russia, ukraine"
heres a more nuanced view of the russiaukraine war,"russia, ukraine"
the only mistake is stopping here ukraine needs more weapons and increased operational capability isolationist tyt are fueling the enemy pacifism is objectively pro fascist this is elementary common sense,ukraine
turks have always hated the west,unknown
exactly this is what everyone has been saying about biden he is unmasked as a war hawk and this screw up ukraine even more and puts the entire world on the brink of ww3 what is wrong with this grandpa not just america hates war the entire world does he is just the worst,ukraine
democrats are trying to justify a war before trump gets in because they know trump is gonna end it all,unknown
nato started the war not russia,russia
every show ana says put trump asidelol,unknown
your casualty number for civilians in ukraine is completely wrong,ukraine
joe and mika bent the knee this weekend sorry to see that all these platforms are bending over for trump and hes ramming it in sad and disgusting,unknown
again the lie that there was an imaginary promise about nato not expanding not written on anything not even toilet paper,unknown
i hear that tyt is having financial problems based on this video im guessing you found a new source of funds comrade kasparian can buy nice shoes and fur coat with rubels dah,unknown
how can increasing defensive capabilities be called escalation thats a russian talking point ukraine wants to slow down the bombing of their cities and civilians and infrastructure and stop the kidnapping of their children extremely disappointed in your take on this youd feel different i bet if this was turkey or armenia being attacked wtf tyt,"russia, ukraine"
greeting from germany thank you ana for peace workshame on genocide joe genocide in gaza free palestine,unknown
its ironic that the punish the democrats pro palestinians have sealed the fate of gaza and the west bank,unknown
tyt has this colonial attitude towards poland czechia and the rest of nato countries that joined in early 2000s you belive us came in and forced this countries into joining nato but it is the other way around us was reluctant but for example poland needed nato to secure itself against russian an enemy since before us was even a colony,russia
or my idea ukraine agrees to give up crimea under one condition they are allowed to join nato imediately then russia would leave them alone nato could entirely wreck russia in three days flat with regular armaments pardon the caps,"russia, ukraine"
ukraine cant win they need to negotiate peace,ukraine
god bless joe biden better late then never it will not change course of the war but would allow ukraine to get catch a breath,ukraine
the american people usually hate war not this one,unknown
just get ready for putin to take georgia too they are already harassing the hell out of georgia and infiltrating its government,russia
putin learned from the us it was fine to steal territory through war i dont think he is a making a precedent here peace lovers,russia
835 ukraine is going to start a giant war with russia start a war that has to be the most ridiculous thing cenk has ever said there has been a giant war since 2022 the conflict started in 2014 when russia sent spetsnaz forces invading the donbass how is russia going to escalate beyond everything theyre already doing including their latest provocation of importing n koreans the war cant get any more giant than it is because russia is at its limit at this point poland could launch an offensive and capture moscow in a couple months the only thing stopping it is russias nukes but putin cant use the nukes without losing chinas backing and oil sales the west never pushed ukraine into war it was never going to seriously invite it to join nato boris never convinced zelensky to not negotiate ana is just dead wrong putin invaded zelensky has been consistently determined to defend his country he hasnt needed encouragement,"russia, ukraine"
why does the blonde woman lower voice,unknown
i watch tyt every day but this take aint it support ukraine till the end,ukraine
i watch tyt every day but this take aint it support ukraine till the end,ukraine
seriously considering unsubscribing after watching this expert analysis sigh so ukrainians shouldve just bent over 3 years ago and let putin take whatever he wants whats happened to you guys you used to know what you were talking about,"russia, ukraine"
you guys can compare the middle east god wars to ukranerussia has killed 200000 apox in ukraine so maybe google some facts,"russia, ukraine"
you still want us to believe that these are bidens decisionsshould it be funny,unknown
go ukraine,ukraine
man didnt need a ride he needed our help,unknown
only frustraiting listening to cenk joining ana in spreading kremlin and conspiracist propaganda genuine kremlin wording kremlin fear mongering twisting historical facts it just has it all,russia
tyt is falling for russian propaganda hook line and sinkerthis is not an escalation russia escalated by illegally invading and annexing land massmurdering civilians on a daily basis and constantly threatening nuclear warthis longrange missile permission is long overdue it simply allows ukraine to take out military supply facilities and missile launch sites that russia has been hiding just far enough behind the border that ukraine couldnt reach them russia has been firing missiles for years from these sites attacking schoolshospitalssupermarketsetc in major population centers,"russia, ukraine"
this is what happens when you have a trigger happy no holds bar spender with little brain left in white house trying to have people killed before he is kicked out once he is no longer going to be the next president all his powers should be restricted and not have the war mongers push him into another global war where innocents die peace not war is required and leaders not politicians are the need of the hour,unknown
peace talks with russia and putin are kidding even if somehow sits down talks and end war he will invade couple take rest country china love see this happen taiwan hello,russia
the military industrial complex loves this almost 900 billion in pentagon budget cannot be accounted for its military industrial complex gone wild,unknown
tyt completely lost the plot on ukraine you have more in common with trump and russia,"russia, ukraine"
putin has wanted a reason to go further than ukraine and biden wants to give him a reason to attack a nato country wed have to defend under treaties,"russia, ukraine"
i thought it was trump that was supposed to bring in ww3,unknown
im betting this dprk story is a phony pretext for escalation am i the only one who remembers the iraq wmd story,unknown
cenk you wanted harris to win do you think the harris administration would be acting any different they would also be prowar,unknown
it could be much more subtle a message trump musk and putin communicated trump promised to end the war although it probably meant somehow screwing ukrainians on a deal for putin to somehow get him elected although were not sure how how do we know putin bragged about it and his associates refer to trump owing them trump gets trolled with melania pix and in a most non trumpian way doesnt cry about it seems bidens message may be interfere with america and align yourself with subversives and there will be consequences,"russia, ukraine"
you cant be antiwar if you start a war said the people whose biggest obsession are jews fighting for their country in a war they didnt start,unknown
the jews invaded palestine you dumb arses palestine has the right to defend herself god commanded the jews through moses with the ten commandments the first being thou shalt not kill solve your problems peaceful and yet the jews have committed every sin since and the fools that support the jews and their evil because the jews told constantine that god is going to reward you if you do wtf yeah like he rewarded the americans for slavery with a civil war those who live by evil means die by them and just like september 11th there is nothing to say that 7 october was not an inside job since it has aided the jews with their clear agenda the ukrainians attacked russian civilians in 2014 committing genocide putin had no choice but to come to their aid all this western propaganda its sickening but continue making out that america is innocent when it is the aggressor and always has been,"russia, ukraine"
tyt should stop covering foreign policy as they obviously know nothing about it and buy into conspiracy theories and russian propaganda russia has been bombing ukraine indiscriminately for years targeting civilians and its about time they are allowed to strike back on russian soil to defend themselves cenks argument about this decision not having any effect on the war is the most idiotic argument i have ever hear from him if it doesnt matter why should the russians care you cant argue that on one hand its a dangerous escalation and on the other hand is has no effect,"russia, ukraine"
i love tyt and ill continue to support them but im afraid i disagree with them on this point i do however respect their opinion on it,unknown
nato never said that it wont expand putin in 2003 himself said that ukraine wanting to join nato was their right and russia wont interfere,"russia, ukraine"
biden doesnt care anymore hes already lived his life gaza fighting will most likely stop when all hostages have been returned stop bringing up trump all of these wars took place under biden and democrats,unknown
602 really cenkisreal was doing that from its conception,unknown
folks do understand north korean forces are being battle hardened in ukraine for the military aggression of south korea,ukraine
dont be weak putin doesnt respond to diplomacy he responds to strengththis weak pathetic dilly dallying by europe and some in the us is what prolonged this war had ukraine been allowed to act more decisively in the beginning while russias war machine was still slow this war would have been over alreadyputin is not going to use nukes against nato his own generals would take him out the minute he orders them togo full tilt now or lose 10s of millions of people later,"russia, ukraine"
why are people worried about trump when you have biden wtf can nobody stop biden he is responsible for aiding a genocide and now starting ww3 america is such a disturbing country,unknown
all the warmongers in the comments should be the first ones in line to sign up for the service all talk no contribution,unknown
democracts love war and the comment section proves it disgusting,unknown
but trump is the war hawk,unknown
yes moscow anna sad sad news,russia
i always get the cold chills everytime someone says ukrain have the right to defend it self but the but is always full of shit,unknown
no cenk we dont love war we love justice,unknown
the reason why we care more about the civilians killed in ukraine than we do in gaza is gaza started the war by killing 1500 innocent young people in israel unprovoked and has continued to vote in a terrorist leadership that probably will keep doing it again if they can whereas ukraine was completely innocent and got invaded so thats why we have to continue to invade gaza to put in a leadership that will not continue the terrorism against israel whereas we dont have the same worry of ukrainians committing terrorism on their neighbors get the difference ana,ukraine
the victim being allowed to defend itself against agression is not escalation,unknown
puppet biden signing off on this is wild smh all this will do is going to bring more pain for ukraine the mother country is going to take off the kid gloves now,ukraine
oh my god theyre on the putin payroll the war was not because of nato lol or because putin was scared of trump before its because the democratic reformer from ukraine zelensky that putin hates was not elected until 2019 and then after that we had covid and then russia invaded after that so thats why they invaded at that time to get democratic reformers zelinski out of power not because they were scared of trump before or were mad about nato lol edit also they really wanted that particular region in eastern ukraine the donbas because that is where the best oil and gas fields are in ukraine not because they have nazis there lol so putin figured they might as well go get them now,"russia, ukraine"
oh right the young arabs will deny ukraine chances to defend themselves,ukraine
biden is going nuts,unknown
you could hardly have shown better that you are simply illinformed naive and blinded by fear on this subject ana and cenkas a country under attack ukraine has the right to defend itself under international law which also means that it may attack military targets on the entire territory of the aggressor russia the critical mistake is therefore not to help ukraine to defend itself accordingly but to impose restrictions on ukraine to use weapons only on its own territory fun fact the west does not impose such restrictions on weapons to israelon this point ana and cenk clearly support russias view that ukraine should not be given this permissionrussia not the us is the one who doesnt want to stop escalating russia let its military invade ukraine russia targets ukrainian civilian infrastructure russia could stop the war at any time by ceasing all combat operations against ukraine and withdrawing its military but russia does not want to stop terrorizing the ukrainian peoplehere too ana and cenk take the russian view that it is not russia but the us that is escalating the situation further and furtherthe current situation is that neither ukraine nor russia can resolve the war militarilybut ana and cenk are again taking russias point of view and claiming completely unrealistically that russia is about to win the war militarilyrussia is well aware of the power of its mendacious propaganda and its empty threats of escalation or wwiii illinformed naive and fearblinded people believe every word from the kremlin and thus become putins useful idiots as you can easily see from the absurd statements of ana and cenk in the videorussia has no interest in wwiii it is not even capable of defeating ukraine militarily within 3 years so how is russia supposed to compete with the entire might of nato for almost 3 years now every country in the world has seen that russia is militarily weak and now on the verge of economic collapse due to western sanctions which country apart from north korea would want to fight alongside russia in a war against nato and why china out of loyalty certainly notand ana again repeats the longdisproved lie that the ukrainians did not continue peace talks with russia in 2022 because they were ordered to do so by boris johnson any editor or journalist who takes their job seriously and has looked into this matter knows full well that the ukrainians broke off peace talks with russia because of the revelation of the terrible russian war crimes in bucha,"russia, ukraine"
not surprised by all the pro war right wing democrats in the tyt comments,unknown
you failed to mention that russian land incursions have only happened under obama and biden trump finish wars and the dems start them,russia
the mistake was not going in harder earlier and providing everything ukraine needed to protect itself all the blame for this war is on putin it could end tomorrow if the russian military just got out of ukraine,"russia, ukraine"
russia is winning the war 3 years and thousands of casualties on them cand all they have a few counties on the eastern side i dont really consider that winning,russia
i am amazed at the doubling down hardcore globalists in the comments who reject even most of their fellow liberals and instead actually favor war with russia some of yall liberal commenters are more neo con and more war mongering than bush and rumsfeld,russia
cenk is a clown he doesnt know why putin invaded,russia
the timing of this is highly suspicious if i didnt know better id say biden was trying to escalate this war to leave a bigger mess for trump when he takes office,unknown
dems are trying their best to fk up as much as possible before trump gets in,unknown
love you guys but youre wrong on this one biden should have taken off the boxing gloves well over a year ago have you learned nothing from vietnam and korea the russians are not winning simply occupying land and mining it isnt winning when you have such a huge casualty rate and extreme loss of equipment allowing the ukrainians to destroy russian supply and infrastructure is how you win a war i do agree that it seems stupid that biden waited so long do this but he also waited too long to drop out the the race this time around we can agree to disagree,"russia, ukraine"
spy sp 500 doesnt like this but lockheed lmt and general dynamics gd are luvin it,unknown
trump wanting the war to end is bending over for putin putin will take his gains recover and invade again in a few years,russia
so russia is allowed to escalate time and time again is ok but when ukraine retaliates it is bad get it in your heads that russia is threatening europe and has to be stopped now remember that us uk and russia guaranteed to protect ukraine in order for them to give up their nukes biden and sullivan has been to slow for long now russia will never use thei nukes,"russia, ukraine"

i think ukraine should have been allowed to attack in russia long agorussia started the war for the most part their people are going about their day as normal unless you may live on the borderlet them send some missles into major cities in russia just as russia is already doing in ukrainesecond its a bunch of bs that russia is always calling the stipulations of helping ukraineoh if you let them do this we can do that now they have got weapons and troops from another country to help an offenseso yeah us should allow ukraine more drastic measiures,"russia, ukraine"

western corporations have drooled over exploiting ukraines natural resources since 2008 they western governments to instigate this war as early as 2012 this war was 100 instigated and pushed for by western corporations using western governments as their puppets biden is still their puppet biden was ordered to expand the war before trump can take office and shit it down ukrainians have been slaughtered and hundreds of billions of us tax dollars wasted because corporations want to pillage ukrainian natural resources if china and russia had done in mexico what we have been doing in ukraine since 2012 the us would have been forced to invade mexico wwiii to benefit corporations and the military industrial complex has always been the goal now biden is following his orders and trying to make it impossible for trump to stop,"russia, ukraine"
way too long in coming biden has dragged his feet through this entire conflict,unknown
get russia out of ukraine,"russia, ukraine"
does usa citizens want to fight a nuke war,unknown
american politicians main interest never was to end the war quickly imho i think the us even had strong incentives to prolong the war in ukraine for three reasons1 to make it as costly and damaging as possible for russia2 to strengthen us corporations involved in the military industry3 to gain a testbed for future modern warfare against another mayor power without direct involvement,"russia, ukraine"
i think trump is going to be hawkish to russia because of who he surrounds himself with he filled his cabinet with neocons because hes a neocon himself trump is many things not only is he incredibly stupid but he is also insanely gullible he is their useful idiot who will do their agenda and they will tell him that putin thinks hes weak and trump is going to send in more missiles and will try to mess with russia to prove to the neocons and his own narcissistic ego that he is not weak he will escalate just like he escalated the drone attacks and if anyone still thinks trump is puttins puppet he is not he tore up a longrange missile treaty with russia he will mess with russia and china because he cannot help himself he sees himself as a dictator like putin and xi and he sees them as his enemies this is going to end up very bad for everyone,russia
russia started the open war but the us has been bribing politicians interfering in elections expanding military alliances beyond what was assured to russia and generally waging cold diplomatic and political warfare for years not only that but the regions russia is trying to annex demonstrated democratically that they want to secede from ukraine and join the russian federation so russia are justified not only in retaliating but in annexing a region whose democratic mandate was denied and violently suppressed by the ukrainian government,"russia, ukraine"
more like cenk uygur makes critical error in the russiaukraine conflict,"russia, ukraine"
cenki have to disagree with you hereregarding nato promising russia that it will not expand anymore that was never a binding agreement but lets assume it was russia asked ukraine to return their nuclear weapons for security in 1991 yet russia invaded ukrainelongrange weapons into russian territory would help ukraine stop the russian advances and better negotiate a ceasefire most leftwing europeans have been asking that for a while recently russia changed its nuclear doctrine in my opinion its a way to scare the west into not providing any more weapons to ukraine but heres the thing russia was the one escalating and threatening the world with nuclear weapons heres a scenario lets say russia did use nuclear weapons battlefield or citykiller on ukraine do you think the west would say well stop providing weapons absolutely not they will retaliate and destroy russias capabilities thats the last thing putin wants to do unless he wants to see the world endanother scenario lets say the west does nothing and russia took over ukraine would putin stop the eastern block is terrified of a russian military aggression they do not want to live under putins regime lets say putin did not stop and then eventually nato will have to step in to defend if putin did stop he would have difficulty suppressing insurgence with a weakened militaryso the whole war in ukraine is a disaster for putin and russia they didnt expect a strong western response their conventional military is weak asking north korea help nearly 3 years in shows weakness theyve become a pariah state that depends on china and their economy could collapse in the next 5 to 10 yearsquestion then if putin is so concerned about russias security against nato and that he wouldnt invade a nonnato country why did sweden and finland join nato finland borders russia giving easy access for nato to invade i know war sucks and i see why many people are pissed off with the us being indirectly involved but dont fall for disinformation,"russia, ukraine"

trump loses in 2020 with afghan withdrawal hurting joe now joe is like ooh yeah ukraine use them booms deal with that donny,ukraine
cenk and ana i usually have a lot of respect for your opinions because you try to be as honest and objective as you can but in this case you really dont understand whats going on in ukrainerussia1 ana makes it sound like russias incremental advances on the battle field means that theyre on the verge of winning the war at the rate russia is advancing itll take them decades to conquer all of ukraine2 this is a war of attrition and its working russia has extremely high casualties 1000 men per day and they cant recruit enough soldiers to make up for the losses which is one of the reasons why putin is now using nk soldiers2b the russian economy is on the verge of collapse inflation is high exchange rate from rubles to dollars is now 100 to 1 interest rates are record high 21 theyre short of man power not just for the army but in all sorts of industries as well theyre running out of savings to plug their fiscal deficits3 putin wont escalate a conflict with usa when a putinsympathetic president is about to take power in 2 months hell just have to swallow this provocation4 ana has asked what the strategy is against russia this is it wearing russia down without risking a nuclear provocation ukraine is retreating slowly because thats the best way to preserve your army zelensky actually cares about his men unlike putin while bleeding russia dry both in bloodmoney and equipment for each kilometer gained5 its quite likely that trump will try to force a peace that favors russia over ukraine before russia collapses but that doesnt mean that biden helping ukraine is wrong,"russia, ukraine"

i was born in odessa and my whole family still lives there they would rather rejoin with russia weve always felt russian not just us everyone in all the towns and cities near us south and eastern ukraine has way more ethnic russians this is merely a proxy war for america to weaken russia at the cost of ukrainian lives all in the disguise of were helping the ukrainians btw zelenskyy is very unpopular right now in ukraine i speak to my family and friends there often,"russia, ukraine"
its not often i disagree with tyt like this as a progressive from europe the netherlands i really have a different point of view where to start 1 every people every nation has the right to determine its own path poland the baltic states chech republic romania etc they chose to join nato and the eu and the war in ukraine proves beyond the shadow of a doubt they were right to do so putin wouldnt dare attack a nato member state he did ukraine2 usa uk canada the soviet union came to liberate us in europe and the netherlands from nazi rule we should never allow fascist dictators to grab whatever land they want or claim it is somehow historically always been theirs3 funding ukraines selfdefense is cheap compared to having putin and china take whatever they want and abandon international rule of law the conflict in middle east proves this very point the fact that biden supports the occupier going against a plethora of un rulings and ngos advice this undermines usa credibility in the middle east and the world as a whole4 the weak response to the occupation of crimea and south ossetia made putin believe he could do whatever he wants in eastern europe he has been threatening escalation since day 1 of the expanded war in ukraine in 2022 this is no different4 biden and the usa did not start this war putin did 5this is too little too late6 progressives around the world should support freedom of individuals and nations anywhere alwaysread and watch timothy snyder explain all this better than i can,"russia, ukraine"

if you want to know why trump won this is the reason literally this if anyone in congress wants to go and fight this war by all means let them go become a ukrainian citizen and fight it but leave us out of it,ukraine
tyt parrots putin propaganda blame is on both sides some good people on both sides you are pathetic blood of ukrainian children is on your hands this policy change is almost nothing too little too late ukrainian cities are flattened million people died and wounded and tens of millions displaced because cowards from the west are appeasing to russia europe is at stake and you cheer for putin,"russia, ukraine"

why were you not saying russia escalates war against ukraine when north korea joined the war against ukraine do some research plz,"russia, ukraine"
say that to a country who have the right to exist if they deemed so its there choice fighting for your country is in anyone gene if they say no its no screw putin,russia
these 2 goofs i swear russia had been pounding ukraine relentlessly now ukraine can strike back and they are all up in arms gtfoh,"russia, ukraine"
critical error sorry guys youre way off on this one biden should have done this long ago ruzzia fires missiles and drones every night at ukrainian cities its about time they were able to really do something about this dont be scared pootin isnt gonna do anything,ukraine
okay heres the opposing view cenk this was far too little too late if we had given longrange missiles and more capability early on as in 18 months to 2 years ago they potentially would be winning the war right now and it wouldnt be a question we know that russia has these fictitious red lines that amount to nothing second this serves a significant purpose in telling our european allies that they too can send longrange weapons so when trump takes over they will already be sending longrange weapons whether we are or not at that point so you crane can continue fighting and can turn the tide of the war by all accounts ukraine can still very much win this war but the united states and our allies have restricted and handicapped them to the point where they have not been able to succeed sadly,"russia, ukraine"
this is the one thing i hard disagree with if you want to avoid war in taiwan we must support ukraine until victory,ukraine
big fan but this is an awful analysis im sorry to say should palestine cede 20 of their land,unknown
cenk admits russia was told nato would not encroach on its borders yet states that russia started this war,russia
this whole conflict started with the nato asking ukraine to join knowing that putin would be against it he said so many times nato chose to start what putin made clear would be agression i do not say that putin did the right thing but the nato knew what would happen and they still chose to do so now theyre acting like victims blaming it all on russia alone,"russia, ukraine"
responding to aggression is not escalation,unknown
you are wrong and millions will die this is not like hamas and gaza this is a war for actual freedom and democracy not more islamic extremist rule this is about a larger war and taiwan and poland and estonia this is about our allies vs our enemies and america choosing a side which will have knock on effects like we cant imagine you need to have a host who has served guys as youre rich fat millionaires who have no idea how we keep you safe which allows you to make hot takes for clicks pls be better,unknown
and the dem moderates are trying to tell the us biden is one of the best presidents in modern history say what,unknown
i expect ana to soon join the other putin bots that are jimmy dore and dave rubin,russia
sad to see what tyt has become over the last decade tyt is spewing talking points straight out of russian propaganda the rhetoric here is disturbing trying to make ukraine and western allies to look like the aggressors here total gaslighing russia signed treaties guaranteeing the soverignty security and terriotorial integrity of ukraine whatever treaty they sign next will be ignored when the russians decide the time is right to make the next move the russians have no interest in peace other than total ukranian surrender and turning ukraine into a vassal state under their complete control whoever triumphantly declares peace with russia has been achieved will be the next chamberlain russia must lose and the west must see to it that ukraine drives out the invaders,"russia, ukraine"
russia escalates on its own this is right,russia
i have a lot of respect for tyt and cenk especially but on ukraine they have been consistently wrong alongside many american left pundits and many more on the right openly flirting with prorussia talking points ukraine is fighting an existential battle for its right to self determination and if they fall the entire european continent becomes directly ensnared in hot war granting ukraine the right to use longrange missiles should have happened months frankly years ago hitting russian war machine assets where under the cloak of legal handties they have been churning out death weapons without riskwe can have that argument on us military spending and what is too much for ukraine and i would agree europe should expand their own defence capabilities and is by the way i speak as a brit living in the uk we have spent billions every year on military support but separate to that should not be the us intentionally preventing ukraine from fighting back fairly in case they poke the bear when you are fighting an existential battle for your right as a sovereign peoples being told the weapons you can and cannot use is unacceptable many in the us seem unable to comprehend this probably because they feel safe and secure on their basically impregnable north american continent,"russia, ukraine"
these are weapons the ukrainians have no idea how they work we have troops there now helping ukraine and will be the ones doing everything except pushing the button i know this as fact as i know troops who have been deployed there,ukraine
this will allow ukraine to hold the land they took from russia in the north so when trump give putin ukrainian land they will have to forfeit the land they loss to ukraine,"russia, ukraine"
this is not a major escalation they have very few of these missiles left i think the tyt folks should watch this video to understand why some in the center and right are afraid that a turn to the left will lead to communism there is actual sympathy for russia in this video the west did not go to eastern europe to take countries from putins orbit those countries came to the west cause they didnt want to be under the thumb of russia do you remember what putin did in georgia or crimea if nothing is done he just keeps going,"russia, ukraine"
omg shockingly bad this reaction time to unsubscribe no big deal russia involves north korea no escalation at allwhaaaat,russia
biden running out of time to make a mess of everything,unknown
about time the policy change shouldve been done much earlier but i fear with that putin admirer soon to be potus it may too late,russia
you consider this decision a mistake this shows how clueless youre about the geopolitics russia and modern warfare im sorry but youre completely ignorant as youre expressing your strong opinions on something you have no expertise in commenting on just dumb unsubscribing from your channel russia is winning the war youre clueless,russia
by that logic palestine should cede 20 of ita land,unknown
he didnt make any critical errors this is fake news and youre lying,unknown
there are several angles to see this first russia will likely escalate either by trying to use more devastating tactics in ukraine or by arming the us enemies or both second this could help ukraine prevent russian attacks on their infrastructure by destroying the weapons used against them inside russia third this could also help ukraine by disrupting russias logistics and manufacturing which could restrict russias mobilization of troops and equipment fourth if the damage in russia is severe russia may be tempted to use tactical nuclear weapons in ukraine overall this will help ukraine but it wont help them win the war because they just cant ukraine has a demographic disadvantage disparity that will become even more pronounced as the war continues second damage to ukraines infrastructure will continue to accumulate overtime making it harder to rebuild after the end of the war third ukraine does not have nuclear weapons if russia sees itself in danger they will use tactical nuclear weapons in ukraine in conclusion this was a war that ukraine could not fully win from the beginning given us and nato doctrine which is to avoid direct confrontation with russia getting rid of putin would not help as russia sees ukraine as an existential issue so it wouldnt matter who was in charge this war needed to be prevented before it became a war realistically speaking ukraine will effectively lose part of their territory and my prediction is that russia will not sign a peace treaty as doing so would allow what is left of ukraine from joining nato that is not in russias interest russia wants a buffer or control the land between them and the carpathian mountains they will only sign a truce or armistice which would prevent ukraine from joining nato as they would still be technically at war with russia if the us and europe wanted to prevent this outcome once it became clear that russia was about to invade ukraine in 2022 they should have mobilized large amounts of troops on russias borders and forced russia to similarly move their troops to keep them away from ukraine and to bankrupt them moving troops costs money nato and the us wont do this so the outcome of this war was already decided before it began,"russia, ukraine"
quite surprised by the blatant use of russian propaganda talking points you guys usually do a lot better research than this,russia
ana needs to move on and do her own thing she has outgrown cenk and the entire network politics aside she is a talent candance owens and megyn kelly has seen tremendous successshe can be right there with them,unknown
the young turks are so ignorant when it comes to russias war on ukraine,"russia, ukraine"
do followers of this channel know that this war has been going on since 2014 because they act like it just started with russias military aggression,russia
whats the alternative pretend ukraine is winning pretend russia wins,"russia, ukraine"
you know nothing about the war in ukraine stop talking about it,ukraine
i dont mean to burst your bubble but russia is trading missile technology for foreign fighters this cannot be allowed to stand unmet it puts japan and and south korea at risk ukraine has already been striking with drones in russia this is hardly an escalation,"russia, ukraine"
i appreciate the analyzes from the tyt moderators but with putins war on ukraine they show their naive and clueless side towards putin and his terror in europe,"russia, ukraine"
let ukraine start a big war you say totally absurd,ukraine
even if you accept that nato encroachment is the motivating factor of this conflict realize that natos border is right next door putins ambitions dont end with ukraine but hes not about to start with a nato member hes been betting on the alliance fracturing over ukraine and its western members abandoning its eastern european partners which would pave the way for further escalation up to and including military incursions this from the start has been a game of containing russian aggression to ukraine and sadly the wests restraint was to contain it within a non nato state at the expense of ukrainian soldiers and civilians biden has been very cautious to manage the risk of any russian retaliation but frankly at this point there is no credible russian deterrence as cenk and ana breeze over ukraine invaded russia they have been striking deep within russia and striking with shorter range us supplied weapons within russia nothing happened because putin has no credible optionsalso i would not be shocked if trumps team was behind this in part everyone who bought into russiagate like cenk assumed for far too long trump was at putins beck and call and yes hes shown a troubling admiration for dictators but he also like a good dictator doesnt want to appear weak hes not going to just give into russian demands and hed probably like there to be some pressure to strengthen the ukrainian position because yes russia is absolutely winning at the moment and frankly has been the entire time because they have a 31 population advantage and a military strategy of throwing waves of men into the meat grinder as they suffer 71 and 81 casualty ratios compared to ukrainian losses but the involvement of nk shows putin fears further mobilization but cenk is wrong this matters this move is just as much about sending a message to pyongyang that they best think twice about joining this fight,"russia, ukraine"
cant wait until trump get in office and lets russia annex half of ukraine and we can end this whole mess,"russia, ukraine"
this like much of your ukraine coverage was a really bad take youll realize this if in a few years time russia finds itself right up against the borders of poland you really arent going to want that,"russia, ukraine"
the west did say that any country who chooses to join nato and which is in proximity to russia must not produce buy or own any atomic weapons the contract also stated that russia does not have a voice in which country decides to join the nato and russia accepted that so basically it is not true that the west promised russia that no country close to russia can t join nato also even if we had made this promise we nato and therefore the usa too promised ukraine if they get rid of their atomic aresenal we would defend them in case russia is starting aggresions or even a war nobody talks about that fact last put not least the war industrial complex will always win as long we fight wars around the world if we deescalate now and give russia what it wants in 5 years time we will have another conflict with russia and i don t want to know what an emboldend putin will do than europe must start looking after its own security and affaires the usa is neither trustworthy nor commited anymore to look support europe unfortunately,"russia, ukraine"

easy to say its a critical error when youre on the other side of the planet sitting on your couch most europeans support it russia bombards ukraine on the daily with weaponry created domestically and by its allies why shouldnt ukraine do the same russia will not stop after ukraine which is what most of nato realises the right move to make but should have been done earlier,"russia, ukraine"
now russia has the green light to boost up us adversaries with some proper weapons to strike inside the us or eu syria libya yemen etc maybe boost nks and irans nuclear capabilities it begins here,russia
i dont agree with this analysis russia can end the war by leaving ukranian territory at any timei think you guys are cowards and isolationist when it comes to foreign affairs,russia
evil democrats already planned ww3 now desperate cos they lost election biden a one term loser,unknown
so why again does russia want ukraine is it the 1 human characteristic that more is never enough now north korea hey maybe its an ill scratch your back you scratch mine type thinking by north korea hes a warmonger too and he doesnt like us either,"russia, ukraine"
being 45 effective after 2 12 years just to control 18 is not winning if the us lost 55 of all of its military equipment including stuff in storage and had a casualty rate of over 700000 just to control 18 of canada she would be saying the us is losingrussia cant escalate anything like i said its down to 55 of its equipment some of which cant be used in this conflict because its navy ships cant get into the black sea or are hiding in port in the black sea sure russia could use nukes but so can pakistan and north korea,russia
tyts understanding of the ur conflict lacks nuance and should be taken with a grain of salt their position represents american hegemony with a limited understanding of the useunatorussia relationship there are multiple sources on youtube if you want a better understanding of the history and the situation eg,russia
tyt getting checks from putin now too eh you cant let comparison of Putin to Hitler do what he wants how can you be so thick as to not understand that allowing his aggression to succeed will actually lead to more aggression worldwide and likely ww3 not prevent it stop him in his tracks what should have been done from day 1 and the world will be or would have been a safer place for a generation again let putin succeed and things are going to get a lot uglier in europe southeast asia africa and on and on and the global conflict will happen and cost everyone,russia

you guys really need to read up on the conflict to fully understand the situation in ukraine if you spent as much time on this subject as you do on the israelpalestine conflict you might come to the same conclusions most of your subscribers do very very dissatisfied with your interpretation of whats going on,ukraine
this isnt about loving war cenk its about loving freedom more and you seemed to have forgot sometimes war is the only way of getting there,unknown
i usually agree with cenk but he sounds dumb as hell today striking inside of russia will make the war hit home for civilians eroding putin support and making him reconsider all the losses russia is taking,russia
bringing north korea in was already an escalation so what is tyt talking about,unknown
why give putin a kgb agent any credit as if he is an honest actor or a statesman and not a dictator,russia
any peace deal is not a peace deal its a temporary cessation of hostility putin will use it as an opportunity to rearm and continue the war in 10 years with an army thats learned it lessonsas for encroachment in eastern europe all those former warsaw pact nations that joined in the 2000s asked to join why they didnt trust putin russia i wonder why that was,russia
ask yourselves why so many former ussr countries are desperate to join nato nothing to do with the centuries of history of russian invasions im sure tyt talking nonsense as per,russia
cenk wants to reward putin for his war crimes while ana claims she speaks for the ukrainian civilians who are being invaded what silly billys both of them are,"russia, ukraine"
russia deserves all thhe blame what ana and tyt are doing is to demand that the targets of said military aggression ukraine bend over and negoiate with an enemy with bad intentsits obvious that none of these tyt punks has ever served in any army or been invaded,"russia, ukraine"
blame america for putins aggressionright,russia
i hope zelensky doesnt just give in to putin after all this time with trumps weak deal to give putin what he has taken its just a weak deal anyone could do that,"russia, ukraine"
its a lie eastern europe wanted to be in nato,unknown
agree with tyt on 95 of topics but strongly disagree with this take disappointed to hear the same arguments that you hear on rt,unknown
cenk is an idiot and a false prophet ana is an enemy of the state,unknown
at this pace it would take to russia a century to occupy the whole ukraine i think biden did the right thing and i am pretty sure the uk and france will follow soon if germany switch their chancellors soon its most likely gonna boost even more the help to ukraine eu is climbing in power thats the only thing dictators understand and respect,"russia, ukraine"
cenk has been anti biden ever since the israeli conflict happened he is not making sense here obviously we have been involved in the ukraine war by proxy since the beginning this is also a proving ground for brics to observe our resolve it will relate to future conflicts that we may be more directly confronted with taiwan anyone,ukraine
they said trump would cause world war 3 but here goes biden his admistration pushing us closer than any president in history and suspiciously right as trump is set to retake the presidency,unknown
ukraine is the dam for russias expansionism they wont stop except by attrition or the complete absorption of ukraine and their resources at which point ukrainians become forced cannon fodder for the next country,"russia, ukraine"
you guys are soooo wrong on this subject give ukraine everything they need you guys said that russia are winning the war russia has failed almost every objective further escalation say that to the brave ukrainians who have fought with both hands tied behind their backs the whole war has been one massive russian escalation and now you are both butthurt about biden doing what is right and what ukraine has needed since the beginning also why are you worried about russia getting upset we sent tanks russia said they will nuke us if we do this didnt happen we got f16s for them russia said this is a major escalation and they will nuke europe didnt happen russia likes to bluff give em hell ukraine slava ukraini,"russia, ukraine"
im terrified at how trump is going to handle russia and israel because hes so unstable and unpredictable that an all out nuclear war is very much on the table,russia
putin would love nothing more to be able to keep escalating without a response from western countries he has definitely been using fear of escalation against us,russia
you guys are so disgusting on this topic,unknown
what about the brics,unknown
us becomes directly involved in this war putting a mark on our backs great,unknown
so tired of ana saying nonsensical emotionally charged drivel she talks about atacms like they can level a city shes just so clueless,unknown
its not that serious ukrainian drones actually go like 700 miles ukrainian drones actually destroyed lots of weapons depots etc america is too late,ukraine
escalating from all out war,unknown
tell us youre prorussian without telling us so russia can bring in thousands of north koreans can kidnap russian kids and force them to live with russian families can bomb hospitals and child centers can hack critical energy infrastructure but when ukraine gets a better chance to defend itself youre mad its arbitrary red line after arbitrary red line and russia uses this major escalation rhetoric to try to stop the west from helping ukraine be independent,"russia, ukraine"
there are no peace negotiations with russia it wants to de facto rule ukraine and dictate its future you cannot back down for an imperial bully on a land grab maybe next he will eye up poland or another nato country if hes emboldened,"russia, ukraine"
tell me again why ukraine should not be able to use the weapons they alredy have why should they not be able to fire them into russia it makes no senserussia is fireing plenty of weapons into ukraineand as for nato expanding east no promises where ever made to not expand nato to the east the idea of the promise was that nato was not going to take in countries from the warsaw pact the contries to the east other than east germany given that the soviet union agreed to a united germany entering nato it was talk nothing was ever formaly agreed upon nothing was written downsince then the warsaw pact has been desolved and the soviet uninon is no more eitherrussia actually putin himself has at one point in the 2000s expressed a wish to join nato it did not happen but still the idea that nato should not let any eastern europeans countries join because of a promise someone made to the soviet union verbally in the 1990s should stop nato expansion because russia does not like it makes no sense,"russia, ukraine"
wrong this should have been done much earlier and not be pious chamberlains putin laughs at otherwise weak western leaders he laughs at us and starts a new war,russia
russian propaganda surrender youre still telling the fairy tale about johnson zelenskyj would no longer be president today if he had left his people to the russians after the bucha massacre that was the reason not johnson find out what was actually being negotiated back then surrender not peace there is no shame in showing your ignorance anyone who cannot do that is being deliberately stupid,"russia, ukraine"
ukraine wants to be an independent nation nato and the us are supposed to represent the ideals of freedom realistically only when there is some selfinterest involved usually oil the most obvious selfinterest is if ukraine is a nato ally they will forever be the front line between nato and russia nato will have a buffer zone for nato nations facing destruction from russian aggression the next two months may be ukraines dday so it is allin ukraine would be a fool to believe russia will not invade again at this point nato does not deserve ukraine as an ally and certainly do not want them as an enemy as they have done well against all the odds much respect to ukraine appeasement to russia guarantees future aggression with putin in power,"russia, ukraine"
escalation now 616 im confused so ukraine cant defend itselftheir in a full blown war,ukraine
president biden did not make an error this is good for our military industrial complex and our economy its good for ukraine its good for nato its good for western europe its not so good for the russians which is good the only bad thing is that the russians may figure out how to defend against our missiles,"russia, ukraine"
now cenk is trying hard 627 who ever in charge lol,unknown

you cannot describe a sovereign nation being invaded land concurred people slaughtered energy and supplies trying to be cut off you cannot describe any defensive retaliation up to and including striking inside russia as an escalation thats horse shit,russia
what dont be ridiculous how russia can escalate more they are already doing any horrific stuff that they can do atacms authorization is just playing catch up compare to what the russians are allowed to do i am really shocked by your coward position in 1940 that position would be a prohitler position certainly not a churchill one,russia
the supposed antifascist left in the west supporting literal nazis in ukraine is hilarious,ukraine

sorry but this is an immature take russia has invaded a sovereign nation and has murdered hundreds of thousands if they take ukraine they will be sitting right next to poland poland is nato if they decide to take or attack poland they will ignite article 5 and the world ends give ukraine the weapons and tools they need to deplete russian forces and finances keep up the fight young turks are wrong on this take just so they can take the sanctimonious position and criticize biden its low hanging fruit,"russia, ukraine"
no one on the right is pro russia moron move on,russia

cenk does ukraine not have the right to defend itself equally when their people are being killed and their country being destroyed by the russians,"russia, ukraine"
did anyone see the north corean soldiers,unknown
this didnt even need talked about because youre just showing the republican group that dems are dammed if they do and dammed if they dont stop the wishy washy,unknown
but cenks argument can be defeated by simply pointing out that every country has the right to defend itself sure the west and europe helped a little in provoking the conflict but ukraine certainly didnt say no theyre okay with it they wanted to join nato and can you blame them the corruption in russia is horrible even worse than ukraine heck id want to leave too and apparently they even want to fight for that they knew the consequences and still do dont infantilize them by saying theyre the victim they knew the both the choice and the risks,"russia, ukraine"
one more thing let me illustrate how eastern europe and ukraine feel about russiathink united states think cubathe us actually supported a proxy military aggression of cuba in 1961 since then the us has waged economic war against that country in a n attempt to drive it to ruinhow do you think cubans should react by surrendering territory to the us guantanamo bay notwithstandingthat is how ukraine feel,"russia, ukraine"
russia interfered with us elections twice to help trump trump is going to bring a new jim crow era to america fire away zelensky the missiles should read from kamala with love,"russia, ukraine"
cenk encroaching is just an excuse for putin he always said ukraine does not exist a little less bias would help your own middle east cause,"russia, ukraine"

no cenk nato didnt go into eastern europe eastern europe demanded to join natowhyhave a look at eastern europes history last century poland hungary csechoslovalia east germany all suffered decades long occupation by the sovietsso what if the soviet union is gone russia is still there that is something eastern europe from the baltics to the balkans are reminded every day putin may not have invaded ukraine if things had been different but what about the next russian leader and the one after thatto understand how eastern europeans feel about their aggressuive neighhbour to the east you have to be an eastern europeanjust as if you want to know what zionist aggression is like in the middle east it helps if youre a palestinian,"russia, ukraine"
100 correct everyone is quick to blame russia for invading but the west nato provoked russia and started this im sure the us would have invaded cuba during the missile crisis to protect their national security then no one would dare criticise the us the hypocrisy,russia
plenty of blame on both sides you are hilarious considering you more or less consider hamas a resistance movement but ukrainians are somehow to blame for defending their own,ukraine

im of course also but an armchair spectator from europe not knowing all the answers russia also have big problems nuclear threats go only so far otherwise what is putin co stopping to invade all of europethe world when are you going to say nobut whatever what annoys me the most that i sense a clear lack of knowledge of the conflict here so why should we listen here what is the added value for us,russia
cenk putin is following the sudetenland recipe of how to fool democracies it is obvious and it is ignorant reporting cenk dont throw your supporters under the bus,russia

wheres the evidence about north koraen troups nobody believes this lie spouting and lame duck president,unknown
they forgot to mention the fact that those long range missiles are useless without satellite logistics that ukraine doesnt havethat would have to be supplied by the west which will mean we will then be at war with russia in their eyes or anyone elses eyes that possess common sensebiden is lighting the house on fire on the way out the door,"russia, ukraine"
war bad i am very intelligent subscribe for more groupthink garbage takes on complex issues we refuse to put any thought into whatsoever prorussian clowns awful,russia
its not an error but absolute necessity and the entire world has to face with the consequencesif you have started a war between ukraine and russiayou cant stand backthis has nothing to do with bidenthis was natos plan and there is no turn backdont be stupidnaive or angel of peace and deal with the realitystanding back at this point means the western alliance will completely loose more than you can even imagineif russia wont be forced to retreat from the regions she has invadedthe last problem of western alliance will be the sake ukraine,"russia, ukraine"
russia is not in panic has an escalation ladder en differently from our idiotic us governmentsdemocrat and republican who seek to start wars everywhere but they are also serious if the us attacks russia directlywoke western countries should shut up,russia
cenk i firmly agree with you we need an adult in the oval office stat i do not know where all of this instability is coming from but a catastrophe could well be the resultagain senate needs to set a retirement age for all federal elected officials how about ages 65 70 years to avoid problems psalms 21 34 84 a man has to learn his limitations clint eastwood magnum force,unknown

do not listen to us media if you want the tuth listen to the news from those nations involved they are saying the complete opposite of what the us says,unknown
this is the russian channel lets face it this fills in where rt used to be anti israel anti ukraine pro religion of peace that cenk belongs to despite him claiming to be educated this is a pathetic front for russia getting really tired of it in fact its like rt in that it attacks justified topics in the usa but then is very anti american over seas just like rt used to be you guys make me puke with your phony front,"russia, ukraine"
im an eastern european theres a complete misunderstanding of russian ambitions in central and eastern europe in this video i dont like wars at all i have friends who fled ukraine this is not a game of peace and war this is peoples homes and lives were talking about its easy for you to say make peace and loose this or that or dont make peace at all from other people please stop commenting if you dont understand the regions history or the conflict,"russia, ukraine"
ukraine war has been going on for years now tyt had minimum coverage on ukraine during the election cyclebut when its opportune to make bidenharris look bad now its time for coverage since the gaza war provided more shade to throw at bidenharris during the time it was overcovered during the election cycle,ukraine
nah putin have been escalating this whole time dont forget they attacked ukraine first why bring in north korean troops if russia is suppose to be so good besides putin is having a hard time with ukraine they cant afford another war right now with all the tough talk putin well lets see,"russia, ukraine"
discustingly pro russia i hope the russians are paying you wee,russia
he did it to complicate things for trump,unknown
they will start ww3 before trump gets into officeblame it on trump later,unknown
i rarely agree with tyt but i definitely agree on this subjectit was a needless escalation to green light long range missile strikes into russia putin is many things but he isnt a one to back down even if its the last thing he does evidenced by his dead mans hand mutually assured destruction program,russia
ana taking her checks from putin now,russia
tyt is a disgrace at this point and not only due to this these people are dumb,unknown
boris pushed ukraine not to accept a piece deal in the beginning because russia demanded ukraine to disarming and basically make it defenseless,"russia, ukraine"
russian federation is a prison house of nations and races of people,russia
apparently tyt does not support a nations fight for independence and selfdetermination probably will find some excuse not to honor article 5 this is an article 5 gut check for nato nations and its not their land being decimated russia now sees appeasement from the us,russia
this is not escalation this is giving ukraine the ability to defend itself,ukraine
cenk have you forgotten about the often used tactic of deescalation through escalation out strongest and most moral ally use it to perfection joe is learning from the best for peace,unknown
trump should tell ukraine if they use those weapons over the next two months then the us will break off all diplomatic relations with them on january 20th,ukraine
only one way to deal with a bully also are we not trying to help ukraine or not did we not already spend a gazillion dollars we have a vested interest go big or go home,ukraine
why didnt he codify roe v wade on his wya out,unknown
wow a lot of warmongering neoconsneolibs in the comments crazy to see people still justifying this horrific war that could have been ended with a peace deal in april 2022 and avoided all together if the usa didnt put its nose into other continents business,unknown
i normally dont agree with a lot of what you guys say but in this case i have to agree that this is going to be a scary 2 months i really hope things dont go as far as they can but it just might god help the world if it does,unknown
so sad this administration shows such support for fascism and nazism down with ukraine,ukraine
hell ya further escalation what the hell are you talking about you think putin is holding back why are you guys spreading russia propaganda is putin paying you guys too you know russias influencing our elections so not only has russia attacked ukraine russia has attacked the united states and dont forget about their attempt to send bombs to the united states in planes no you guys would rather spread propaganda about how denvers been taken over by illegals and you still havent recanted your lies how many ukraines have died from putins bombs how many children have been murdered by putin im having a problem figuring out the difference between you and fox news we should allow the ukraine to attack russia 9 years ago when they invaded ukraine the solution is just to give ukraine there nukes back so they can defend themselves from russia,"russia, ukraine"
this whole war is a mess i get both sides putin like it or not is a very intelligent man and i believe he loves his country on the other hand you have the right to protect your sovereignty facts though are facts ukraine was working to join nato and there was a guarantee that nato would never be allowed to be next door to russia and that treaty was being broken plus biden was never a serious threat to putin and he knew it what does also to be true but cant call it a fact is that ukraine was known to be corrupt as heck just look at the deals little biden was orchestrating there we know that we just dont know if the president of ukraine was involved,"russia, ukraine"
i do have to say that when i heard land mines were going to be used it pissed me off now that you reported that they only have a 2 week life span it gives me a bit of hope unfortunately war is war and theres no guarantee that they will be the only kind used land mines are obviously too dangerous for future civilians on the other hand when youre trying to hold land its hard to resist lets hope they stick to the 2 week model,unknown

slava ukraini,unknown
here is where american ultra left cenk unite with american ultra right rogan to betray allies,unknown
i was shocked to see cenks tweet complaining about biden escalating the ukraine war by allowing them to use us munitions to strike russia they shouldve done this 2 years ago repeating russian propaganda by saying this is an escalation is super disappointing to hear from a leftist populist,"russia, ukraine"
glad theyre battery powered i think that takes the wind out of most of the critique i know that as lefties we are generally antiwar but we need to remember that there are causes that people think are worth the blood they shed and the lives they give we are ukraines ally ukraine did nothing to warrant an military aggression in fact it gave up its nuclear arsenal decades ago in a show of good faith for peace if ukraine is to not be reinvaded in the future it needs to negotiate from a position of strength and it can only be in that position if it can properly fight against a much larger force the willingness to just abandon the fight and our allies is sort of indicative i think of much of the rot of the left its too esoteric for us here in america weve never been pressed like the ukrainians have,ukraine
whats the problem russians use this mines for years,russia
cenk says russia is the aggressor he needs to read the monroe doctrine on his show then be asked what would the us do if mexico allowed russian weapons on their soil i think the word aggressor would take a different meaning i like tyts and support with funds not talk,russia
lol a mine that becomes harmless when the battery dies whats next disabling a nuclear reactor by turning off the power to the site,unknown
not really a reversal we say no a few times but ukraine and raytheon get whatever they want meanwhile americans starve and are homeless,ukraine
dark brandon leaving a shit show for the incoming administration sounds like a fair trade for the shit show he was handed,unknown
great more uxbs,unknown
fuck up and find out,unknown
hes trying to start ww3 he is a puppet for the globalists they want a war there is no option other than a peaceful negotiation biden already stopped one and a nuclear war,unknown
well he is a dumbass sooooo theres that,unknown
cenk trumps end to the war will not be a true end just a pause for putin to rearm and break treaties in the future and invade again just like he has always done,russia
if you ask me they should have given these permissions to ukraine on day 1 of the full scale military aggression should have stopped russia by force within the 1st month of this war,"russia, ukraine"
this thread is extremely disheartening in the comments theres just a bunch of neocons and warmongers not democrats,unknown
not our civil war its nice to see dems remembering we are anti war,unknown
if usa is in an active war does biden stay in office past january 2025,unknown
this is dumb except for nukes russians are already using everything they have since the first months of the warnuclearcapable iskander missiles are being shot at ukraine all the time since february 2022 shortly after russians also used cluster munitions thermobaric weapons all kinds of mines chemical agents eg white phosphorus in mariupol drones strategic bombers just about everything in their arsenal russia started mobilization since september 2022 and is transitioning to a war economy since then its the west that repeatedly goes through an identity crisis every time they are to deliver a new type of weapon system,"russia, ukraine"
biden is not escalating he is recognising and acting upon the clear and present danger represented by putin who has been waging covert war on the west for years,russia
i totally disagree caving to putins feargame is what he wants putin has been playing the nuclear card for many months now every red line like western tanks f16s was crossed without any retaliation putin has run out of soldiers if we bow to this psychomaniac now ukraine is lost and so are we eventually the war is over on the day putin sees his goals of occupying large swaths of ukraine is in danger,"russia, ukraine"
i always hear this argument escalation needs to stop go tell the russians that ukrainians were invaded cities literally obliterated over 20000 children kidnapped execution of prisoners intentionally bombing hospitals supermarkets why is it when this argument comes up it always people asking ukraine to not escalate when they are the ones fighting for their very survival its such a backward way of thinking thats like asking poland or france to stop escalating when they got invaded by the germans russia can literally end this war tomorrow by withdrawing their troops biden has simply given the ukrainians the ability to fight without their hands tied behind their backs the authorization was for strikes only in the kursk region putin is not going to nuke anyone he has been saying that since the beginning to try and get the west to back off and let him take what he wants do we want to set a precedent from here on out that threatening to use nuclear weapons to get what you want is okayyes we want the war to end but a just lasting peace will only be possible when ukraine is in a position of advantage at the table because if we let putin take the land he has conquered it only rewards this type of behavior in the future which will lead to actual us troops on the ground,"russia, ukraine"
if the roles were swapped uger and anna would be screaming but because it comes from biden its more about hey its not really an icbm said so nonchalantly,unknown
america is embarrassing itself by provocating russiathe truth is russia cannot be defeated by media propagandathe war in ukraine has exposed the west vanurability bcz every weapon they provided thinking would change the war received a more powerful response from russiaits time the west came back to their sense before the world is put in a nuclear war,"russia, ukraine"
biden fails at everything now he threw a tantrum after losing america will pay the consequence,unknown
russia escalated by bringing in north korean soldiers into the war im going to have to unsubscribe tyt you are trying to spread fear in the american portion of your audience by acting like putin will actually go through on his threats everyone saw how well their initial military aggression went putins oligarch buddies have been siphoning money meant for the russian military for decades and their pathetic military aggression exposed it ukraine has almost got this in the bag and now you are trying to get americans to back out if ukraine backs down now russia will recoup with nk and steam roll them within a year president zelensky will be klled by putin fck you you cowards what happened to americans between 1776 and now even the russian bots are agreeing with this channel now,"russia, ukraine"
wow president biden may just be doing this for a reason,unknown
what is going on here i find myself increasingly agreeing with tyt,unknown
biden is enabling genocide its time for a war crimes arrest warrant to be issued,unknown
i follow you guys but you have no real knowledge of the history that predates all of this,unknown
bidens spending as much as he can of your money on warfare ukraine should be responsible for costs in the future not being let off the hook for billions in aid you end up for this bill for a war they cannot win while the richest get richer from it and 75 of americans will pay it for years and years,ukraine
not one single comment mentions why russia invaded ukraine back in 2000 secretary of state james baker of the united stated told russia that nato would not be moving one inch eastward russia told nato they did not want military bases on its borders just like the united states would not want to have russian military bases in northern mexico that is the real reason why the war started,"russia, ukraine"
its okay we cant pronounce cenks name either,unknown
this is why liberals lose they give in they give up,unknown
if we hand ukraine to russia because putin threatens to attack us with nuclear weapons then he will obviously use the same threat to demand the next country be handed over moldova will be first then georgia armenia azerbaijan and probably estonia all putin has to do is say surrender or i will attack with nuclear weapons soon it will be turkey that is next on putins list a nation that has wavered in its support for nato but become a bit more willing to stick with the alliance since the military aggression of ukraine what would we do then hand over turkey because putin has threatened us,"russia, ukraine"
there is no such thing as a humane war once war starts there will be unimaginable suffering and the manner of death is secondary the defending country has no choice but to use whatever weapons it can get because more people will die if the military aggression succeeds the idea that somehow putin will do something worse if the us provides weapons to ukraine is not logical putin is already as brutal and murderous as he can be if he were able to hold another draft he would do so he cannot because it would inflame opposition in russia if he were able to persuade his generals to use nuclear weapons he would do so he cannot because most of his generals dont want to be killed in a nato attack and would not follow such an order using icbms to carry conventional warheads is just posturing it is a very expensive way to deliver a conventional explosive,"russia, ukraine"
russia wouldnt have invaded if the usa refrained from including ukraine into nato the us shouldve stuck to the treaty,"russia, ukraine"

are we still pretending biden has been running the country we will be lucky if this administration doesnt get us all vaporized he knows trump will stop the war when he gets in and that is why the biden administration is doing it,unknown
seems like tyt is leaning hard right these days progressives were in support of ukraines right to defend itself until they needed a reason to criticize democrats to keep their progressive credentialsrussia is allowed to escalate by bringing in a whole other country into the fight when they start losing but we cant give them the tools to defend themselves couldnt have been threatening nuclear war since he invaded ukraine hes trying to scare you out of ukraine so that he can take land all of the escalation on russias part are acts of desperation because they couldnt take ukraine in 3 years,"russia, ukraine"

ww3 is more likely if ukraine gets no weapons,ukraine
russia has no choice what if iran set up camp in mexico would usa set back passive and not do anything or would we do the same thing russia is doing,russia
losing is not an option for russia they will not allow nato to set up camp right beside them this will be a threat to russias survival in the future this is all a big future plan for usa to try to overthrow russia all because of the democrats russia will not be another saudi arabia weapons of mass destruction for the nwo to go in and overthrow them and take all the riches left behind,russia

tyt should go back to covering relevant topics like pronouns and recreational abortions,unknown
selfneuralizing mines are not 100 reliable they can still be dangerous even when rendered inert by time the battery that sets off the explosive running out it becomes far less likely theyll explode but some of them still can because the explosive material and vessel are still there its like shooting an inert grenade 99 of the time the grenade will just break and never explode but rarely the detonator gets hit and it instantly explodes in the case of electronically triggered landlines maybe a keyfob on the same frequency as the detonator unlocking a car nearby triggers it and it explodes or maybe it getting run over by a farm tractor causes a spark against the explosive material and some poor guy becomes a cripple landmines are really horrible unpredictable weapons and no one should be using them,unknown
i am sorry but cenk said something in this video that is not the through when he said that short range missiles that have been use until now cant carry nukes in fact almost all of the types of missiles russia usedtochka iskander kalibr zircon kh22 kinzhal in the last three years can carry both conventional and thermonuclear warheads,russia
if russia continued winning as you call it at their current pace it would take them 40 years to take all of ukraine dont think they will last that long,"russia, ukraine"

stockpiling and deploying antipersonnel mines is supposed to be a war crime since they affect civilians way more than military targets,unknown
we told ukraine they could get rid of their nukes and now we are going to abandon them what present does the set none trusts the us anymore we will have no allies,ukraine
the us are not giving money to ukraine to help them they give them money to make this war last as much as possible to weaken russia and to provoke putin they created that conflict starting in 2014,"russia, ukraine"
if you listen to people like cenk your country will get taken over if you dont stop russia they will own your country,russia
so russia can attack ukraine in ukraine but you dont want ukraine to attack them back in russia you making them fight with one hand behind their back,"russia, ukraine"
both sides have been using mines since day 1 of this war false outrage,unknown
correct this is a bad idea no mines lets end this war should have been done a long time ago,unknown
we are at a tipping point i think russia is going to strike us assets conventionally somewhere in the world,russia
tyt does not understand that its either this or capitulation and genocide at the hands of russia russia will not stop they will take the red light to rebuild their forces and do this again in 35 years to get the rest of ukraine with moldova lithuania latvia and estonia as the next targets russia started this war and created the main escalation its insane to think that ukraine is the problem here,"russia, ukraine"
its not biden hes just a puppethes simply following orders from his dark masters from the shadows,unknown
biden is trying to start ww3 before he leaves office,unknown

to all the clueless idiots attacking tyt here listen im not a progressive leftie but tyt is right for all those who are saying russia should just leave spoiler alert theyre going nowhere why becase they did leave when they signed the second minsk agreement but ukraine violated it with support from the us biden administration germany and the uk former chancellor of germany angela merkel admitted that the west and ukraine had no intention of abiding by the agreement when they signed it was more to buy time to rearm ukraine do you think putin is going to believe them nowwhat interest does putin have in eastern ukraine it was formerly a part of the russian soviet republic rsr under the former ussr including crimea by the way the leadership committee of the ussr unilaterally decided to carve up the boundary and give those to ukraine thats why the majority of ukrainians who live in that region are russian speaking which is why over a million of them fled to russia when the war broke out you can search the exact number its publicly availablethe ukrainian government most of whom are ukrainian nationalists were bombing that region as part of their ukrainisation policy ie ukraine for ukrainians and really escalating it after the coup of 2014 the russian speaking people in the donbas etc pleaded with the kremlin for help but putin held back he watched as those people were bombarded until he couldnt take it anymore so hes not going back and good luck trying to convince him to give up any land that horse has already bolted the best ukraine could do is negotiate a ceasefire they overplayed their hands,"russia, ukraine"
so the biden administration has made a decision that will result in dozens or hundreds of young russian men sent into a war they dont want to be in by putin having their legs blown off good one joe,russia
theyoungturks come on guys biden providing land mines to ukraine a major escalation are you kidding merussia has been laying out millions and more millions of notsotemporary mines since the start of this war ukraine is the most mined country in the world by now and now if you start whining that ukraine gets to lay out mines that will last 4 or 12 hours and if defect 14 days on their own land or is it just that when russia whines you whinei can agree to a lot of what you are saying with regards to israel palestine but you dont seem to want to recognise who are the victims in the ukraine war double standards all the ways down,"russia, ukraine"

further escalation is inevitable though it ends when russia wants it to,russia
the thing is people like putin and kim jong countries like russia and china and north korea do not live in the woke liberal bubble of the western world and have the same views of equality and diversity that you do they dont have respect for women which is why kamala harris would have been a disaster because they dont respect or acknowledge a woman as an equal so are not in anyway afraid of her i guarantee putin will back down and lower the rhetoric once trump is back in because he does fear and respect trump as an equal it all comes down to what putin does while useless biden is still asleep at the wheel until january but what is certain is that waving rainbow flags or having bull rings through your nose or demanding the progressive woke agenda be followed will have no effect on people like putin or his actions get tough is the only response he will understand,russia
there are no civilians in this twisted world,unknown
what do you think the united states would do if russia had said that it was ok to to send missiles against new york city and went ahead and did so cenk does not have the capacity for impartiality,russia

biden trying to set the place on fire on his way out no matter where you stand politically at this point everyone should acceptembrace the fact that trump will end this conflict yes ukraine will have to give away territory and yes thats unfair but thats a hell of a lot better for the rest of the globe than the alternative escalation at this point is ridiculous,ukraine
america sends unlimited military support to israel then backs them by sending an aircraft carrier we arent escalating anything sends ukraine mines this represents a serious escalation,ukraine
cenk needs a history lesson on how this war started he is waaaaaay off on his analysis,unknown
cenk russia is going to win when trump comes in so ukraine should give their land cenk on palestine fight for your land hypocrisy at its finest,"russia, ukraine"

hateful old man willing to sacrifice human life for politics and pride,unknown
biden is going to take the world into a nuclear war,unknown

we started this war this is bidens pet war he started it the state wanted to see russia in action and dared russia to cross the border they are happy to use ukraine as a proxy yo bleed russia white regardless of the ukraine casualties zelensky has been paid well for the sacrificial offerings of his country they were never expected to last so long now the deep state fears the end and would perfer nuvlear war as an exit strategy before americans start shining lights at their doings in ukraine this is not the american peoples war this is bidens and the establishment,"russia, ukraine"
spiteful hateful old bastard smearing his shitty diaper in our faces,unknown
yeah the explosives in the mines will sudden not explode after the battery runs out never ever forever,unknown

old joe must be desperate to avoid a Ukrainian surrender until he can get out of town,ukraine
fact russia is the agressor who has for over 1002 days committed countless warcrimes in ukraine inc directly targeting and practising their weapons on civilians kidnapping thousands of children murdering torturing civilians prisoners of war etc etc etc for two years russia has been invading ukraine by sending in meat waves of very poorly trainedequipped soldiers that is russia is deliberately sacrificing its own soldiers to take land you want ukraine not to kill the invading army tell russia to stop invading not sure who the good guys are see the wikipedia pages atrocity crimes during the russoukrainian war war crimes in the russian military aggression of ukraine international criminal court investigation in ukraine child abductions in the russoukrainian war torture and castration of a ukrainian pow in pryvillia legality of the russian military aggression of ukraine faced with this terrible choices have to be made if the west had properly supported ukraine they would not need such things,"russia, ukraine"

warmongering joe biden started ww3 fact checked,unknown
i cant take it anymore i am so sick of the democrat party it has become everything that i hate i am seeing two reactions from democrats involving this whole situation one being denial and the other a call for war with a major nuclear power if it hits the fan i wonder how many liberals are willing to strap up and fight to protect ukraine,ukraine
oh are you not only against israel you are also antiukraine now,ukraine
hey democrats just think you could have had 4 more year of the senile war monger,unknown
which gov meddled and toppled the former elected president of ukraine and installed their puppet in the form of zelenskyy,ukraine
what i see is a bully what is going to stop this bully from wanting more you ever see a bully reason who wants war we dont but the bully who initiated this hasnt backed down there could have been a more legal way to approach a disagreement but the bully chose aggression take the power away from the bully,unknown
biden is executing perfectly many policies will be reversed as a slow incremental esculation of weapon capability is pursued this is the only way to beat russia without invoking a nuclear ww3 response when trump takes office and kills support other nato countries will step up and continue this planned esculation of weaponry russia will eventually lose 8yrs left in this war imo,russia
remember when cenk said vote biden cuz trump might start ww3,unknown
immoral,unknown
anna wtf just look at the weaponry russia uses against ukraine and you might want to criticize them instead of bashing the ukrainians who are trying to defend themselves against occupying forces have you ever seen that wardevastated landscape there is no mans land anymore seriously,"russia, ukraine"
liberals really obsessed with warslike god dammthey even calling trump evil for wanting to stop wars,unknown
if the democrats want to they could get joe biden out of office just like they got joe biden out of the election they could get him out of office they just dont want to,unknown
biden is going directly against what us citizens want,unknown
funny how this maniac is funding pushing for destruction on russia because they are doing the exact same thing as israel other the other front this monster is funding and pushing for destruction and genocide of palestinians biden and all complicate should be charged with war crimes and locked away for life,russia
deescalation is usually the job of the attackers not the defenders instead of spouting russian propaganda why not stop and think why is ukraine fighting russia,"russia, ukraine"
if you dont know exactly why the democrats are doing this you might be a progressive,unknown
im not prowar but seeing as trump is coming into office is basically prorussia russia now has north korea fight with them i dont really care biden is giving them these mines i am however pissed that biden okd more arms to israel thats a bad call,russia
biden is a war criminal and shouldnt be able to just ride off into the sunset of course thats assuming we survive this,unknown
lately you guys have been making great videos on stuff the matters not the slander stuff before the elections just you viewpoint back with evidence to support it much better job,unknown
hes trying to bring america in this war before he leaves office this is pure evil and should be called as it is,unknown
the democrats as a party had become more reactionary than republicans biden is actually worse than george w bush the man had voted for every war in congress i should have seen this coming in the meantime homelessness is skyrocketed in major us cities gave ukraine 60 millions for more wars,ukraine
it is unbelivable how biden has escalated american input in this war weeks before he leaves office he is making sure the weapons manufacturers make their fortune and then make more money when they go back in to clean their mess up,unknown
and you are worried about trump cant you see that biden and his administration are criminals and monsters putting fire to our world,unknown
his final gift to the american public on his way out wwiii anyone paying attention knew this guy was bad news before the 2020 election shame on anyone who voted for him or harris,unknown
two months to somehow cause ww3,unknown
it showed biden is also old warcriminal because of the election he had to act with restrain now he lost and shackles are off and he goes full escalating weapondelivery warmode no matter the costs in the long run like ukraine may missile in russia and use banned mines what is next for israel same strategy more weapondeliveries and warning people not to stop him like bernie,"russia, ukraine"
why are we worried about nuclear armageddon we should be worried about abortion rights,unknown
ill be honest i just started watching tyt again everyone deserves a second chance,unknown
blackrock and haliburton have over a trillion dollars invested into rebuilding and owning large pieces of the land of ukraine they are the ones calling the shots,ukraine
these mines are not against any law they actually will decommission themselves after a few months unlike the ones russia is using which will be there long after the war and will hurt civilians so sick of russian talking points being pushed in our mainstream news guess that is just going to get worse this january when a known rapist and russian operative becomes our next president,russia
honestly woman you so worried about gaza but when is ukraine defense its dangerous escalation what a hell theres no escalation for ukraine they are already being killed for 1000 days wheres your outrage at this russia will never stop unless someone stops it so sad to see even you talking for russia,"russia, ukraine"
i fi was a cnn anchori would stop the broadcast and quickly sayim really not ok with thisvietnam waste of money afghanistan waste of money iraq waste of money i would seriousl yrathe rwork at mcdonalds or subway that broadcast ww3 in a positive way the crazy thing is all through the iraq was afghanistan i have watched cnnjust be pro war forevergiving us tasty little snippets of how the weapons work to murder people with the plans the strategies vietnam us pulled out lost afghanistanpulled out lost iraqbarely made a difference to the place syria pulled out aswell and let russia in and used proxies instead trillions of dollars,russia
another war that we will be funding for dacades costing trillions of dollars we had just gotten out of afghanistan,unknown
well if these mines can help ukraine more power to themwhen trump takes office with his cabinet of circus peanuts lord help us all,ukraine
i wouldnt want to be a battery tester,unknown
ana bought out by the russians,russia
yak yak yak yak boom,unknown
ya know if it gets us peace and stops ww3 id be ok with turing joe over to the russias,russia
607 the short range missile cant carry nukes the cruise missiles and ballistic missiles they have been firing since the start of the war can carry them please do some basic research,unknown
warmongers,unknown
fck ukraine joe needs to go asap before he starts something trump cant fix,ukraine
this is a very american pov but i dont think zelenski will be intimidated by trump he knows exactly what trumps like by which i mean completely unreliable and unpredictable i would hope that he is trying to get closer ties to europe because its actually europe that is in most danger if ukraine falls i think if we dont stop putin he will be like trump encouraged im in uk so im not particularly worried rule britannia but if i was in eastern europe id be very worried,"russia, ukraine"
ana is so hot,unknown
what a bunch of clowns these people are the only thing wrong biden is doing is that he should have done this two years ago tyt do you think russia is playing nice with international rules fuck no get a clue those international treaties only work if both sides follow them and russia never has you cant win a war by being on the morally superior side russia will never nuke ukraine without a direct threat being made towards him he knows that it will escalate the war into a full blown conflict with europe and he knows that china is deeply against the use of nukes and might pull all support from russia stop thinking you can play nice with russia,"russia, ukraine"
ana,unknown
i would urge president putin not to start firing nukes at the us because from the things ive heard theres a lot of support for him among the people now,russia
can i just underline something here people you are all too much focused on what the puppeteer wants you to focus on if youre going from a clear example of a war of current dynamics at play it would be a nation of desperation versus the entitlement of one person do you really think that if the man were to have the support that ukraine has combined from one thingto be a nation and avoid falling into the hands of russiayou would have a threeyear war like you have nowthere is no reason why russia needs to be desperate its the biggest country there is so its only entitlement from a selfish one seeking to rule all versus something that is actually wanting to have a little bit of land to be a nation that everybody agrees upon in that nationhe cannot win the war because he has not had the people behind him from the start do you really think people are willing to die just because they are at the mercy of their own leader if thats the case for what reason would they die so he can get a little bit more land out of it they may have been sitting by with conflicted thoughts but they were not yet so much influenced because the war was taking place on the other sidebut do you really think that if russia is threatening others with i will nuke you or i will destroy your country that he is not also putting his own population at risk threatening someone elses nation inherently means threatening your ownremember he cannot even get his own people or even his soldiers to fully align with his motivations dont be fooled by him or his rhetoric he might say oh yes i will destroy you but if there was really a red line and he was truly suicidal what difference would it make now for him to push the button he doesnt do that because ambitious people are not suicidalthey are driven by anything else but suicidal thoughts they want to rule they want to be feared they want to control and if you are stepping out of life with everybody else its not even uniquepeople need to exist to feel fear you need existence to acknowledge your satisfaction of being feared and of controlthere is no way he is going to have any leverage its only about coming across as though we wouldnt be here otherwisethink about this if you are a country that thinks it has everything under control why would you need to control your peoples viewpoints this means the oppositehe doesnt have control thats why he is so desperate to prevent the real narrative and reality from reaching them if they get to see the truth they wont align or stand behind their socalled big leaderwhy would you need to control what others see you would only need to trust that what you believe they also believe that is true controlwhen you dont need to control the outer world coming inward to reveal whats really happeningdont be fooled support ukraine and never ever join the side of letting him win with a bluff that is absolutely nothing more than a bluff,"russia, ukraine"
its ironic that leftists claim to be antifascist and antiimperialist yet they support ukraine a nation that idolizes ww2 nazi collabators and nato the biggest imperialist force on earth,ukraine
go biden,unknown
the claim that russia doesnt use the same type of mine with a mechanism for selfdestruct or rendering inert is false btwthough they also use old mines that dont have that same as ukraine does,"russia, ukraine"
btw ukraine is part of the ottawa treatythe us is actively helping ukraine to break international law,ukraine
first what the hell is that title dangerous aboutfacesecond stop taking russias side in this land mines are a purely defensive weapon and there is zero justification for banning them against an opponent waging an offensive warseriously stop trying to handcuff ukraine while its fighting against and expansionist superpower which us promised to protect it from,"russia, ukraine"
all i can say is thank god hes only got a few more weeks with power because these decisions are seemingly getting more reckless,unknown
russia only increases its army and efforts to gain military superiority constantly and especially this fall823 yes exactly but arent mines mostly used to defend the territoryand how do you know russia isnt bluffing are you telling us russia is going to fight more better now,russia
and people wonder why voters turned away from the dems its not about trump being awful as an individual its about the larger more systemic problem within the establishment being insidiously corrupt and dangerous for decades trump might be a mental illness for the collective consciousness but right now more people are concerned with the cancer they have realised is ingrained in the us system that will kill the host faster so as a life long leftie i get it i get why people voted against the dems in terms of ukraine it was a longterm goal going back decades this was never putins war the us set the sights on ukraine and usurping russia as europes supplier of energy years ago and now biden is trying to leave an impossible mess for trump so that he doesnt undermine the deeps states goal and that its interests are forced to go forward if you cant see that you are blind,"russia, ukraine"
we are not a signatory on the mine treaty neither is ukraine and russia have used them since the beginning its ukraines land and its already full of mines and they said they want them this isnt an escalation anna the russian shill,"russia, ukraine"
we are not a signatory on the mine treaty neither is ukraine and russia have used them since the beginning its ukraines land and its already full of mines and they said they want them this isnt an escalation anna the russian shill,"russia, ukraine"
biden is going to clean this up yeah ok,unknown
ukraine fired 12 atackams and wounded a nk general what did we get in return a terrifying display of nuclear capability all this for what,ukraine
russia wont use a nuke trump is coming into power and putin wont risk pissing him off by proxy pissjng america off and china and india who all said dont use a nuke this was an escalation because russia took north korean soldiers to kursk to fight ukraine and russia uses missiles and drones from iran and north korea iran get weapons from russia and send them to hezbola to fight israel ukraine are the strongest army in europe right now like what is going on if we just helped them by not rising aid by blocking it whatever they are a strategic partner and if they fall europe will be in a bad position and incase you didnt know they are on our side russia iran china north korea all want to be number one do you want them to be in our position what the world will look like then ofcourse not stop taking russias bait they have lied since the start of this war they will not nuke ukraine over this ukraine can already strike further than himars with drones so the argument is mute,"russia, ukraine"
the biden administration is the worst in history theres no way i would ever vote democrat theyre nuts seems like every decision the democrats make ends bad for the us,unknown
the whole world is so sick of us aggression dems should be forever unelectable after this party of lies jside and ww3,unknown
most americans dont know anything about foreign affairs because they are either stupid or ignorantthe us has been at war 225 times since it was founded in 1776invading foreign countries around the world and killing millions of innocent people which war did you ever won since the end of ww2 of course with allies like russiaengland and franceafter that you lost in vietnamafghanistaniraq and many others,russia
most americans dont know anything about foreign affairs because they are either stupid or ignorantthe us has been at war 225 times since it was founded in 1776invading foreign countries around the world and killing millions of innocent people which war did you ever won since the end of ww2 of course with allies like russiaengland and franceafter that you lost in vietnamafghanistaniraq and many others,russia
is it any wonder the world is moving on without the us,unknown
why is the us always starting wars in foreign countriessince they were founded in 1776 it started 225 wars which one did you have ever won since the end of ww2lost vietnam afghanistan iraq and on and on it goes,unknown
are the russians actually using landmines or is this just another lie to support more of their own vile tactics i suspect that russia is not using landmines since landmines are an inhumane way to prevent opponents advances and i believe that russia is doing all the advancing so they wouldnt be using them,russia
biden is a great president he also sends a message to the chinese about taiwan trump the fake alpha is going to cave like a crap you know whats going to happen if the west doesnt cave not the end of the world but putins end a bullet in the head because thats how the russians deal with these things do you really know that the russians want to die for this old weirdo or for a land they do all that circus because they feel that we are some weak snowflakes,russia
no piece of unexpended ordinance is every truly inert if nothing else these will be repurposed to fight the war for gorilla fighters for years long after the war has officially ended,unknown
biden doesnt want to get slapped around anymore leave with a bang,unknown
you mean the proxy war between the usa and russiabecause the whole world knows it now,russia
obama,unknown
it would be best if you changed your name from young turks to young russian russia is use hypersonic weapon every day on the civilian populationits not an escalation for you,russia
you are completely wrong first trump will not end the war he has no influence on putin and putin will do what putin wantsif america stops supporting ukraine zelensky said recently that they will lose the warsecond ukraine has right to defend against russia and they got the right to use mines russia is used them every day,"russia, ukraine"
umtheres about 70 did missiles bigger than atacms exculate that ladder i reckon,unknown
ukraine is a divided country with a long history with russia a big part of the population is prorussia but the ukraine government doesnt care even took military actions against them since 2014 ukraine needs to sort out its own problems before going to a higher level like being part of the nato,"russia, ukraine"
jenk simply pointing out the fact that russia is the aggressor and their deliberately being unfair as a way to keep an upper hand in their military aggression but expecting us to continue hindering ukraine is not a good method for us ukraine and natoon top of all this your against israel too so i must ask why are you against the us so much yet your comfortable with residing here,"russia, ukraine"
rumour has it putin used potatoes as a counterweight in this experimental missle,russia
russia can end this today by leaving ukrainethey refuse to leave unless they get something for it,"russia, ukraine"
worrying about mines in ukraine is already way to late the place is probably already the most mined place on earth with the old style forever active russian mines really this is all out wwii style war and the only things not being used so far as we know are chemical and nuclear weapons neither side wants to cross that line for obvious reasons worrying about escalation is also way to late this is not a conflict or a military action its an existential war you cant expect ukraine to not to hit valid military targets in russia using whatever weapons they have even if we dont let them use our weapons they are quickly developing their own and those can hit much deeper into russia,"russia, ukraine"
it is better if bidenkamala are removed from the government before we get in wwiii it is svary to have lunatics in the white house,unknown
biden just authorized ww3 you still think democrats are the lesser evil youre completely insane if you do,unknown
right now the ukrainians need anything and everything because when trump comes in jan the war aid from the states will be cut off additionally the russians have internationalised the conflict with foreign mercernaries and north koreans frankly if the ukrainians used a million land mines at this point just to further throw russia and allies into a terrible meat grinder i would be frankly relieved the price the nato nations are paying in dollars the ukrainians are paying in blood and their soverign soil if russia gets to win this war may the victory be so pyrrhic so that their demographics are forever destroyed and they cannot wage another ground war for another 20 years may the opportunity not go unnoticed by china and may china annex russian land demoralising the nation beyond the point of recovery,"russia, ukraine"
now this is something worth discussing opinions over when it comes to ukraine its something i really dont agree with,ukraine
making it clear that we would and will make ukraine a peer or near peer force would make russia think twice hand wringing has only helped russia and prolonged this insanity singing a nuclear retaliation treaty with ukraine would evaporate any chance of nukes being used mad has worked for more than 70 yearsthat means it works guys,"russia, ukraine"
russia can always leave ukraine problem solved,"russia, ukraine"
biden is about to leave the office and he doesnt hold back anymore,unknown
dont think soputins army and arsenal of fighting vehicles has been depleted so hell think twice if he tries to invade another countryand so will china,russia
get it over with call the clowns bluff,unknown
it seems this will end with a large reduction of the population it looks like nostradamus prediction is coming to pass the war would start with a failed agreement we have two that has occured the american and nato agreement not to surround russia and the returning taiwan to china when you add this stunt a warning a ballistic missile being used it could have been nuke tipped a strong warning,russia
i thought these disgusting things had been banned they are still digging this crap up from world war one and two you people are such assholes,unknown
biden lost for a reason,unknown
biden setting trump up to deal with a war,unknown
no putin is escalating whether you keep up or not,russia
it seems to me that this war will end with a huge explosion the likes of which the world has never seen,unknown
i dont like mines but the russians are using them prodigiously and theres no way in my mind ukraine should be limited in using them as well war sucks russia started this dont forget it,"russia, ukraine"
this is bidens final f you to his party america and trump the left created him now youre mad cuz hes mentally unhinged what a joke,unknown
what does escalation mean really its a kind of dumb excuse escalate a full assault on a nation military aggression widescale missile attacks airborne assault indescriminant bombardment killing of prisoners rape murder aerial bombardment naval engagements and you think a landmine somehow is an escalation other than blunting mass infantry assault how how it turn up and heat it doesnt it drives towards stalemate,unknown
theyre testing the icbms now that are meant for us,unknown
democrats gotta democratsmfh,unknown
jack were dealing with nazis in russian fascist world war ii is happening and we have them a white supremacist on his way back to the white house that white supremacist is in putins pockets we dealing with fascism and america and we deal with a mad man with nuclear weapons here at home and over there in russia what could go wrong so we need to stop bullshitting ourselves and understand this is it this is the downfall of the united states its gonna be a mushroom cloud because we too dumb to realize that our voters but a mad fool who didnt give a damn about us when he was in the white house the first time he want to put troops on our soil to control migrants instead of looking at the world and understand america is no longer gonna be part of it we have a nazi problem,russia
if the end of the world as we know it were dealing with nazis,unknown
i dont see how this is more of an escalation than the authorization to strike within russia landmines suck but it is indeed their persistence that makes them so dangerous i dont know how much i trust the pentagon to ensure that the battery life is sufficiently short but in theory its a good mitigation,russia
biden is trying to start wwiii,unknown
ok so your plan is to allow every nuclear power to do whatever they want look in your history books we are not supporting ukraine enoughyou are afraid of a nuclear war me too but with this policy the only protection against military aggression are nuclear bombs so when ukraine looses and the us withdraw from europe you will also give up taiwan and apac and then we will get many new nuclear powers till the end of the decade including ukraine poland iran japan and south korea maybe even germany australia canada and mexico today there are 9 and it is hard to control some of them north korea israel and russia what do you think will happen if there are 20 30 or 50 countries with nuclear bombs a lot of countries only declined nuclear weapons because the us protects them like ukraine did they gave their bombs to russia for a safety guaranty by you and russia if you aren not trustworthy anymore guess what they will protect themselves and as you guys are about to proof only nuclear bombs can do the job,"russia, ukraine"
we shouldnt be involved in this war not our war not our problem,unknown
usa weapons are junk the russians shot down all missiles,russia
what a peacefully transition of power lmfao escalate the war that trump is ending soon last ditch move from dems to try and embarrass themselves,unknown
biden wants to start ww3,unknown
the end of the world,unknown
is senior biden going send usa troops to ukraine,ukraine
548 the shortrange ballistic missiles that russia launches into ukraine every week can definitely carry nuclear weapons cenk is so confidently wrong sometimes its hilarious,"russia, ukraine"
the battery may die but the explosive charge wont and will be collected by future wannabe terrirists well done joekamala,unknown
theyre nonpersistent mines you care about ukrainians civilians yeah right stop being afraid of russia,"russia, ukraine"
old man gonna press the red button,unknown
we need to stop funding ukraine they are not going to win people keep saying that ukraine is a democracy but its not and hasnt been it has a dictator that is only allowing state run media we need to get all the war mongers out of our government,ukraine
biden is making very dangerous decisions that can lead to wwiii he is not mentally fit to be president,unknown
how about biden stops sending the weapons at all,unknown
one for sure this giving russia and china time enough form bricks more kinda this thing happing on the other side of the world and the war with russia than china is really going make russia and china a new trading blocso is there anyone really smart in the white house cause it wont change when trump is in there more dummies screwing the world,russia
turks keep supporting the deep state you dont see what biden is doing,unknown
we turks love putin and are paid by him shame on you,russia
biden and trump share something in common they are both old and like starting wars lets see biden wants world war 3 with russia then when trump gets back he will stir the shit with china then off to war china cause can see trump doing in the pacific somewhere,russia
im so confused why are they letting biden make decisions he can barely wipe his own azz ughhhhhh,unknown
at least the landmines expire not certain the russians will be that virtuous sarcasm,russia
this administration doesnt know what its doing should have provided all of these things years ago,unknown
good,unknown

omg joe looks like squirrel i was always like hmmmm who does he reminds ofcome to think of it he reminds me of squirrel,unknown
so america is funding the opressor israel on one hand and funding the oppressed ukraine with the other hypocrisy at its finest the us government has found a way to fight in wars without actually joining them when its none of their goddamn business,ukraine
if it was up to tyt you would just give up to the russians putin would love you guys,russia
joe biden stop helping ukrain bringing their never ending war here at home you fooooool,unknown
wonder if they did this because trump won,unknown
of course ukrainians are the victims of unspeakable injustice and our hearts should always be with the people of ukraine ending on the note of we must remember russia is the one that invaded is the same as when bill maher says we must remember hamas picked this fight that mentality attempts to put all of the blame on the aggressor of these events but illustrates a picture of that being the beginning we can not ignore the histories between all these countries and americas role,"russia, ukraine"
seems like a good time to stop funding proxy wars,unknown
mr zelinsky should you decide to take this job beware that these mines will selfdestruct in no more than 2 weeks should you be captured the us government will deny any knowledge of the this assignment,unknown
can wait for squirrel joe to gets lost,unknown

and i told my wife this would happenand she didnt believe me i didnt vote because i knew trump would win anyway im not a trump fan but people like biden and harris are basically tools of the pentagon and the war machine to keep ukraine sovereign we should risk wwiii why just why to help them build a fake democracy like the one we have this shit is insanity,ukraine
between ukraine and israel joe made the democrats unelectable,ukraine
every viewer should be reminded that cenk ana both are imperialist pigs and pro genocide they opposing any assistant to ukraine from america from day one btw ukraine using atacms for months already in russia from russian point of view crimea and other regions of ukraine has been declared as russian by russia they are taking hits from atacms shtorm shadows over the year and no response or escalation d,"russia, ukraine"

america has been expecting ukraine to fight with one hand tied behind its back while russia has been hitting ukraine with everything its got either you want ukraine to win or you dont if you want ukraine to be successful then stop holding back vital weapons theres no such thing as a safe war the ballistic missle launch by russia is a sign that russia is scared and that its desperate to intimidate the west,"russia, ukraine"
it doesnt matter trump is going to be in office soon and the war will be over poof,unknown
i am soooooo exhausted with american tax dollars funding endless wars lets spend it on the american people that lost everything in the floods hurricanes wild fires or border security,unknown
biden obviously wants to hand off a messy situation for trump to deal with it gives ukraine a chance to stockpile these weapons between now and january before trump takes over and cuts aid to ukraine off entirely in favor of his buddy putin im sure biden will also pass off knowledge how ukraine can build their own after trump cuts off aid biden is most likely also establishing a network of private funding to ukraine by big players so ukraine can continue to cause pain for putin after biden has left office regardless of trump cutting them off it makes things difficult for trump he wont be able to give his buddy putin the upper hand in the fight like hed like to do i think biden should find many ways to bog down trump before he leaves office leave trump all kinds of messes to have to deal with keep trump off balance,"russia, ukraine"
if palestine had the same capabilities as ukraine im sure cenk would say the palestinians have every right to use everything in their arsenal to push back against the invading aggressorsbut when it comes to ukraine its appeasement the us isnt the one escalating anything its the actions of putins escalation that the us is responding tooi agree with you guys tyt on almost 90 of the time on your domestic policies but on this particular foreign issue you guys seem to be on putin propaganda payroll,"russia, ukraine"

one of the standing principles of natootan is that anywhere the mines exist the organization will clear the devices if asked,unknown
im giving biden the benefit of the doubt since he has access to full intelligence data in addition his policy may have always included the change to allowing ukraine to use the missiles on facilities in russia proper,"russia, ukraine"
he is so pissed off that donald trump won that he is starting world war 3 unbelievable if a war totally breaks out and donald trump is president he will be a wartime president and if by some miracle he gets them to stop fighting he will go down as one of the greatest presidents ever biden really screwed the pooch,unknown

its amazing how many brain dead leftoids have swallowed the red bait after years of russia conditioning the leftoids are now the war mongers arguing in favor of the military industrial complex and intelligence agencies,russia

where are the progressives marching in the streets where is the phony bernie sanders not banging on his senate desk exposing biden and his war loving party,unknown

have to disagree that the russians are the aggressors this war began not in feb of 22 but with the coup we helped sponsor in 2014 and the attacks on russian speaking people after that in donetsk lugansk and odessa with attacks on union members and other civilians there were attempts at a negotiated settlement several times but the west never held to it but pushed for the ukrainians to fight to the last man this is a proxy war of the us and nato to try to destabilize and weaken russia if the us stopped sending arms this could be solved in negotiations,"russia, ukraine"
we need these things at the us boarder,unknown

biden wants to escalate and start world war iii before trump gets back in office he even increased his open border policy this is just pathetic they dont care if the whole world goes down along with them,unknown
so since people dont understand what theyre doing with that s im gonna explain very simply hes doing this is going to continue to do this until trump gets into office and trump has 1 or 2 things continue to do it or back down like the little b boy he is which he will do and he will make america look weak so biden is forcing trumps hand to show americans that hes just a big old fat loser whos a weak little b but maybe im wrong,unknown

the brits have never understood that the uk is no longer an empire that its only a normal country among other normal countries they seem to think that india africa australia canada the us new zealand are still theirs britannia rules the waves in the case of ukraine the british hypocrisy is all the more disturbing because it was them who toghether with the us attacked iraq in an illegal war causing hunderts of thousands of dead with no other reason than their belief that the near east and indeed the rest of the world is still theirs there is so much poverty in the uk but their successive governments know nothing better than to play empire which is utterly pathetic considering that the uk today is nothing but an us colony,ukraine
these people do nothing but ask loaded questions with propoganda inserted they basically lie as they ask the question the truth is that russia would have never attacked ukraine if the us wasnt so determined to arm them and bring them into nato what russia is accomplishing is keeping weapons off their border its pretty simple,"russia, ukraine"

i wonder if sky news realizes how petulant and childish its reporter appears in this video,unknown
directly involved means uk hittingattacking russia from its territory this is indirectly involvement butthe failure of uk is while being an unsc permanant membersiding alongside a criminal nation that killed people of russian origin living on its ground attacked russian security and claiming ground from russian territory unsc have been build to uphold law and justice among the uns butas we witness they are siding with a criminal nations in addition russia is an unsc permanant member nationtoo,russia
isnt it remarkable that russians are responsible leaders the united states and its western allies have been instigating the government change in ukraine since 2014 leading to ongoing chaos and the deaths of over 14000 russianspeaking civilians the claim that the united states cares about ukrainians is questionable given their actions such as involving the uk prime minister in peace agreements in turkey at that time no ukrainian soldier casualties or city destruction the use of specific weapons which require satellite guidance and programming by the west and the us indicates a level of involvement beyond simply supplying arms this suggests a deeper entanglement in the conflict with russia,"russia, ukraine"

the tv moderator obviously dont understand what the problem is his questions shows typical british arrogance yes the brits are fully responsible for disaster in ukraine,ukraine
didnt russia annex the entire eastern oblasts of ukraine so ukraine has been using them on russia for ages now if anything they say is to be taken seriously besides any invaded country has the right to take the fight back onto the territory of the aggressor unlike the aggressor who has no right to bring in other countries like nk to help them when they pathetically fail in their war of aggression in addition the ambassador is contradicting old vladolf who has openly admitted the revolution in ukraine had nothing to do with this blatant act of imperialism,"russia, ukraine"
russia is right and sky news is wrong,russia
if uk soldiers deploy uk weapons on russia then such is indeed an act of war from one nation against another nation the whole world knows how stupid the different uk goverments have been in the last two decades and the whole world that is not the west meaning 88 of the world does know how much the uk is involved into this self created proxy warthus uk citizens can expect some fireworks if uk soldiers operating on ukrainian soil shoot of more missiles i wonder if stalmer or whatever his name is did prepare the uk people for the consequences of his actions,"russia, ukraine"
when putin sent his ambassador home to russia and he closed the russian embassy down thats when we should start worrying,russia
all things being fair and with russia saying that the uk is directly involved due to military material being used in russia then clearly iran china and north korea are directly involved due to their military or duel use material being used on the side of russia in ukraine,"russia, ukraine"

russia is crying that no one is holding ukraines arms locked on its back any more now can ukraine finally hit backand russia goes ynk ynk ynk ynk ynk ynk ynk ynkpathetic,"russia, ukraine"
and russia is still going to surprise everyone who new about the new weapon the best thing is not to support ukraine but to help find truse,"russia, ukraine"
the crown is the source of this idiocy usa and uk should not have stolen ukraine in 2014,ukraine
call out the western leaders on their illegal act,unknown

nato expansion british missiles our idiot leaders would inflict war famine and global destruction on us all not in my name,unknown
the sky reporter wants to teach the russian government how they have to judge the situationthis is dangerous to play the teacher without knowing the facts,russia
the interviewer is wrong on everything he tries to make the viewers of this video believed that it is russia which escalates the war that interviewer is disgusting he is a dirty propagandist of the current mp following the globalist imposed on him by the wef,russia
there is a treaty signed by russia that russia will not attack ukraine and if they do the allied forces will defend ukraine sorry why is russia crying now time to ramp up pressure on putin stick or twist putin,"russia, ukraine"

what evidence supports claims of russian involvement it appears that mainstream media is collaborating with political elites to generate public support for a heightened military engagement in ukraine there is a systematic effort to depict russia as a principal adversary to the current administration thereby framing it as an impediment to national security this narrative effectively rationalises the deployment of young soldiers into active conflict zones serving to further imperialistic ambitions and reinforce us military supremacy and hegemony in eastern europe,"russia, ukraine"

wait and see what will happen in eu and uk soon russia is not afghanistan or irak they have the same technologies as nato does and some of them are even much more advanced this was an attack by nato on russia idiots,russia
when you dig into this story a bit you find that there is nothing to indicate russian involvement but that this has been happening for months in the us stretching back to 2023 langley edwards navy seal hq and an unnamed nuclear base near vegas have all sighted these drone swarms remember the balloon that flew half way across the us before being shot down just a suggestion but why not shoot down one of these drones and see if it has made in china written on it,russia

what is a longrange missile the hysteria about atacms and storm shadow anders puck nielsen u tube,unknown
the sun is basically the most trashy lousey propaganda maker the uk mainstream media has,unknown
we in the uk have had drones flying around airports in the past in fact previous instances not that long ago lead to changes in the law and requirements for drones over a certain size needing a licence to fly and markings to identify them all this piece amounts to with no data is propaganda its the russians it must be the russians bad russians,russia
aliens,unknown
this is total horse all uk airports and military bases have counter drone technology and gps blocking systems in place which prevents drones entering secure airspace,unknown
atacms is not long range wise up,unknown

self inflicted security issue allowing russian persons to work and live in our country what do you expect from our total lack of security we deserve our arses kicked alongwith all the boat arrivals for years tottally self inflicted look to parliament past and present,russia
sorry but why are uk troops being deployed they have their own security perhaps there are things going on at the bases is perhaps plane spotters journalists etc are trying to find out about building up of planes ready for nato strike on russia,russia
the headline is a bit dramatic and anyway russia have satellites if they want to look at us bases funny they havent been seen at raf fairford,russia
allies dont need drones unlike russia we have satellites that can tell if a russian sentry has dandruff or uses head and shoulders,russia

blame russia for everything without any root whatsoever the title makes it look like it is definitely russia ffs im really getting tired of being told who to hate by the msm and the government its literally pathetic,russia
probably unloaded them from that russian ship that was stuck offshore,russia
propaganda bs to get people the stupid ones more accustomed to a possible attack on mainland britain probably also to test the water to see how much the stupid people will just consume media without checking,unknown
so we only have hearsay that small drones are flying near american airbase and we have to look for the baddy of the moment ffs get a grip,unknown

did they fly from moscow to the united kingdom,russia
ufos not from this world,unknown
if drones are flying over why are them not being shot down,unknown
its probably the uk,unknown
i dont think it is anything to do with russia in fact all cia and gchq bases are probably being watched by uaps or the old exspresion ufos i observed one recently near a base and it was nothing humans have got and i have seen alot of aircraft it was stealthy and let me see it and silent and could move instantly,russia
